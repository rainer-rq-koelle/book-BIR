## Flight Rules

flights can be conducted under visual flight rules (VFR) or instrument flight rules (IFR)

VFR permitted in certain types of airspace, with 1 exception, only under visual meteorological conditions (VMC).    
IFR flights can be conducted in any meteorological condition (and any airspace).

### Use of Air Traffic Services

FLIGHT PLANS ~ operational flight plan required for all flights.    
ATS flight plan should be filed to permit ALERTING SERVICES to be activated, if required.    

ATC clearances are issued solely for expediting and separating air traffic and are based on known traffic conditions.    
If an ATC clearance is not suitable, the pilot-in-command may request and - if practicalbel - obtain an amended clearance.

Issuance of an air traffic control clearance constitutes authority for an aircraft to proceed only in so far as known air traffic in concerned.    
ATC clearances do not consitute authority to voilate any applicable regulations for promoting safety or for any other purpose.    
Clearances DO NOT relieve a pilot-in-command of any responsibility whatsoever in connection with a possible violation of applicable rules and regulations.

ATCU units shall issue ATC clearances as necessary to prevent collisiotns and to expedited and maintain an orderly flow of air traffic.    

If flight plan  specifies that initial portion of a flight will be uncontrolled, and that the subsequent portion of the flight will be subhect to ATC, the aircraft shall be advised to obtain ist clearance from the ATC unit in whose area controlled flight will be commenced.    
If flight plan specifies that first portion of a flight will be subject to ATC and tha the subsequent portion will be uncontrolled, the aircraft shall normally be cleared to the point at which the controlled flight terminates.

When requested and agreed by pilot of other aircraft and so authorised by appropriatee ATS authority, ATC may clear a controlled flight, including departing and arriving flights, operating in airspace class D and E in visual meteorological conditions during the hours of daylight to fly subject to maintaining own separatio to one other aircraft and remain inv VMC.    
When a controlled flight is so cleared the following shall apply:    
+ clearance shall be for a specified portion of the flight at of below 3050m/10.000ft during climb or descent and subject to further restrictions as and when prescribed on the basis of regional air navigation agreements;
+ if there is a possibility that flught under VMC may become impracticable, an IFR flight shall be provided with alternative instructions to be complied with in the event that flight in VMC cannot be maintained for the term of the clearance;
+ the pilot of an IFR flight, on observing that conditions are deteriorating and considering that VMC will become impossible, shall inform ATC before entering IMC and shall proceed in accordance with the alternative instructions given.

Provision of vertical or horizontal separation aby an ATCunit is not applicable in tespect of any specified portion of a flight cleared subject to maintianing own separation and remaining in VMC.    
If is for the flight so cleared to ensure, for the durationof the clearance, that it is not operated in such proximity to other flights as to create a collision hazard.

VFR flight must maintain in VMC at all times.    
Clearance to a VFR flight to fly subject to maintaining own separation and remaining in VMC has no other object that to signify that - for the duratio of the clearance - separation from other aircraft by ATC is not provided.

Objective of ATC do not include prevention of collision with terrain.    
The procedures prescribed do not relieve pilots of their responsibility to ensure that any clearrrances issued by ATC are safe in that respect.

### Change from VFR to IFR

ac operate in accordance with VFR wishes to change to compliance with IFR shall - if a flight plas was sub mitted - communicate the necessary changes to be effected to its current flight plan OR    
submit a flight plan to appropriate air traffic service unit and obtain a clearance prior to proceeding IFR when in controlled airspace.

### Change from IFR to VFR

ac operating under IFR encouters VMC shall not cancle its IFR flight unless it is anticipated and intended that the flight will be continued for a reasonable perriod of time in uniterrupted VMC.

Change from IFR to VFR flight shall only acceptable when a message initiated by the pilot-in-command containing the specific expressing CANCELLING MY IFR FLIGHT together with the changes, if any, to be made to the current flight plan is received by an ATS unit.    
No invitation to change from IFR to VFR shall be made by ATS either directly or by inference.

### Instrument Flight Rules

#### Applicable to all IFR flights

* aircraft equipment ~ ac shall be equipped with suitable insturments and with navigation equipment appropriate to the route to be flown and in accordance with applicable air operations legislation
* minimum levels ~ except for take-off or landing, or when specifically authorised by the approprate authority, an IFR flight shall be flown at a alevel which is not below the MINIMUM FLIGHT ALTITUDE established by the State whose territory is overflown, or where no such minimum flight altitude has been established:   
  + over high terrain or mountainous areas, at a level which is at least 600m/200ft above the highest obstacle located within 8km of the estimates position of the aircraft;
  + elsewhere than as specified above at a level which is at least 300m/1000ft above the highest obstablce located withini 8km of the estimated aircraft position.

Note: "estimated position" ~ accounts for navigational accuracy on the respective route segment, NAVAIDS available on the ground and in the aircraft.

#### TIME

time reference under IFR: UTC   
expressed in 24hours and minutes (possibly seconds) beginning at midnight.    

clocks to be within 30 seconds of UTC.    

time check myst be obtained, normally from an ATS unit, prior to operating a controlled flight and at such other times during the flight as may be necessary.

time in datalink communication: accurate to -/+ 1 second of UTC

#### AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLL CLEARANCES

ATC clearance must be obtained prior to operating a controlled flight, or a portion of a flight as a controlled flight.    
Clearance is requested by submitting a flight plan to an ATC unit.

Flight plan may cover only part of a flight, as necessary, to desribe that portionof the flight or those maneuvers which are subject to ATC.   
A clearance may cover only part of a current flight plan, as indicated in a clearance limit or by reference to specific maneuvers such as taxying, landing or taking off.

Whenever ac has requested a clearance involving priority, a report expaining the reasons for the priority should be made, but only if requested by ATC.

Europe:

* clearance expires at a certain time
* take-off not before <<time>>
* unable to clear at flight levels requested
* join airways at a particular time and place and not before <<time>>
* ATC reclearance in flight.

If prior to departure it is anticipated that depending on fuel endurance and subject to re-clearance in flight, as decision may be taken to proceed to a revised destination aerodrome, the appropriate ATC unit shall be notified  by the instertion in the flight plan of information concerning the revised route (where known) and the revised destination.

The purpose of this is to facilitate a re-clearance to a revised destination, normally beyond the filed destination aerodrome, a procedure known as the reduced contingency fuel RCF or decision point procedure.

#### Taxy Clearance

ac operated on a controlled aerodreom shall not taxy on the maneuvering area without clearance from the aerodrome control tower and shall comply with any instructions given by that unit.

#### Adherence to Flight Plan

ac should adhere to FPL route, speeds and altitudes unless a change has been requested and authorised.   
In emergency, an ac can deviate from the FPL, if the circumstances require it but the appropriate ATS unit must be told of the emergency and the deviation as soon as possible.

Unless otherwise authorised or directed by the appropriate ATC unit, controlled flights shall - in so far practicable

+ when on established ATS routes, operate along the defined centre line of that route; or
+ when on any other route, operate directly between the vaigation facilities and/or points defining that route.
+ on a route defined by 2 VORS, switch navigation guidance from the one behind to the one in front as neas as possible to any defined change-over point.

CHANGE-OVER POINTS should be established on ATS route segments defined by reference to VORs where this will assist accurate navigation along route segments.    
The estbalishment of change over points should be limited to reoute segments of 110km/60NM or more, except where the complexity of the ATS routes, the density of the navigational aids, or other technical and operational reasons warrant the establishment of change-over points on shorter route segments.

### Intended FPL Change

FPL changes must include:    

* change of cruising level ~ ac identification, requested new cruising level and speed at this level, revised time estimates (when applicable) at subsequent flight information region boundaries;
* change of route, destination unchanged ~ ac identification, flight rules, description of new route of flight including related flight plan data begining with the position from which requested change of route is to commence; revised time estimates; any other pertinent information.
* change of route AND destination changed ~ ac identification, flights rules, description of revised route of flight to revised destination aerodrome including related flight plan data, beginning with postion from which requested change of route is to commence; revised time estimates; alternate aerodromes ; and any other pertinent information.

### Weather Deterioration Below VMC

VFR flight operated as controlled flight AND unable to maintain VMC on its current flight plan shall    

* request an amended clearance enabling the aircraft to continue in VMC to destination or to an alternative aerodrome, or to leave the airspace within which an ATC clearance is required;
* if no clearance can be obtained, continue to operatie in VMC and notify the appropriate ATC unit of the action being taken either to leave the airspace concerned or to land at the nearest suitable aerodrome;
* if operated within a control zone, requrest authorisation to operate as a special VFR flight; or
* request clearance to operate in accordance with IFR.

### Position Reports - ICAO

unless exempted, a controlled flight must make position reports at each designated compulsory reporting point OR when requested.

position reports:     
+ time passing the designated reporting point
+ flight level
+ any extra information specificed with is often the ETA of the next reporting point and the name of the next reporting point beyond that.
+ speed control restrictions should be included; reported as IAS below FL250, above as Mach number

controlled flights providing postion reports via datalink need only provide voice position reports when requested

if specified in PANS-ATM, SSR mode C transmission of pressure altitude satisfy the requirement for level information in position reports.

### Position Reports - Europe

In EU region, postion reports should contain aircraft identification, position, time, and flight level, unless otherwise specified.

areas with reliable radio communication, pilot and ATS unit and where SSR labels and Mode C information are permanently displayed to ATCO, the initial call need only contain the aircraft identification and level, subsequent position reports, if required, need only include identification, postion, and time.

### Termination of Control

A controlled flight shall - except when landing at a controlled aerodroeome - advise the appropriate ATC unit as soon as it ceases to be subject to Air Traffic Controll services.

### Communications

ac operated as controlled flight must maintain continuous air-ground voice communication watch on the appropriate communication channel of, and establish 2-way communication as necessary with, the approprate Air Traffic Control unit excpet as may be prescribed by the appropriate ATS Authority in respect of ac forming part of aerodrome traffic at a controlled aerodrome.

SELCAL or similar automatic signalling devices satisfy the requirement to maintain air-ground voice communication watch.

If using controller-pilot data link communication CPDLC, the requirement for air-ground communication watch remains in effect after CPDLC has been established (to ensure voice for fallback/emergency).

EUROPE   ~ all ac operating above FL195 in EUR region must be quipped with 8.33kHz channel spacing.    
ac operationg in uncontrolled airspace may be required to maintain a listening watch on specified frequencies.

### Communication Failure

ac fails to maintain or etablish contact with aeronautical station, try another frequency.     
if atttempt fails, attempt contact other ac appropriate freqs or 121.5 MHz, including the air-to-air frequency 123,45MHz.

if this fails:     
- SQUAWK 7600 and if ADSB equipped - select COMMUNICATION FAILURE
_ transmit its messages twince on the designated frequency(s) preceded by the phrase "TRANSMITTING BLING" and - if necessary - include the addressee(s) for which the message is intended; and
- intention of the pilot

subsequent actions should be:     
* continue in VMC
* land at the nearest suitable aerodrome; keep watch for visual signals
* report the arrival by the most expeditious means to ATC.

if IMC or when conditions are such that it is not feasible to complete the flight in accordance with VFR, then

IMC or IFR - NO RADAR SERVICE    
unless otherwise prescribed on the basis of regional air navigation agreement, in airspace where radar is not used in the provision of ATC:    

* maintain the last assigned speed and level OR minimum flight altitude if higher
* for a period of 20 minutes following the ac's failure to report its position over a complusory reporting point, AND
* thereafter adjust flight level and speed in accordance with filed flight plan

IMC or IFR AND RADAR SERVICE AVAILABLE    
in airspace where radar is used in ATC:     

* maintain the last assigned speed and level, or the minimum safe altitude if higher
* for a period of 7 minutes; 7 minutes start from
  + point when the transponder is set to 7600, 
  + the last assigned level is reached, or
  + the time the aircraft failed to make the last compulsory position report, whichever is LATER
* when being radar vectored or having been directed by ATC to proceed offset without a specified limit, rejoin the current flight plan in the most direct manner possible and no later than the next significant point.

### EU Differences

IFR flights 

* maintain the last assigned speed and level for 20 minutes after squawking 7600, if failure occurs outside controlled airspace;
* then proceed according to filed flight plan;
* if not limit points specified, rejoin the flight plan route at the next significant point.

Where PIC of an IFR flight encounters VMC and elects to continue to fly in VMC, the pilot will set Mode A code 7601 in EU airspace

IMC or IFR - subsequent actions

* follow the flight plan to destination and enter the hold at the designated NAVAID; commence the approach as close as possible to the last acknoweledged expected approach time EAT. if not EAT has been received and acknowledged then commenct tha approach as close as possible to flight plan ETA;
* complete a normal instrument approach;
* if possible land within 30 minutes of the latest EAT or flight ETA, whichever is later.

### Action by ATC

loss of 2-way communication, ATS unit will use all available means to contact the aircraft including 121.5MHz, relays and SELCAL.

ATCO should determine whether or not the ac's receiver is functioning by instructing the ac on the channel by making a specified maneuver or by instructin the ac tsquakw IDENT or make SSR code and/or SDSB transmission changes.

Note: ac to squwak 7600     
ADSB equipped ac may transmit appropriate ADSB emergency and/or urgency mode

ATCO to repeat on any other available channel on which it is believed that the ac might be listening.   

In both cases any maneuvering instructions shall be such that the ac would regain its current cleared track after having complied with the instructions received.

When established that ac radio receiver is functioning, continued control can be effected using SSR code/ADSB transmission changes or IDENT to obtain acknowledgement of clearances.

### Complete Communication Failure

When ac experiencing complete communication failure and operates within area and flgith levels wehre an ATS surveillance service is applied, NORMAL SEPARATION rules may continue to be used.

If ac experiencing communication failure is NOT IDENTIFIED, separation between identified ac and all unidentified ac observed along the expected route of the ac with failure, until such time as it is known, or can safely be assumed, that the ac with failure has passed through the airspace concerned, has landed, or has proceeded elsewhere.    
ATCO will increase separation to an acceptable (judgemental) level. (?!?!?!?)

### IFR flight within Controlled Airspace

IFR flights shall be subject to ATC when operated in controlled airspace.

cruising levels ~ IFR in controlled airspace must be operated at appropriate FLD.   
in cruise climb, it must operate either between 2 IFR cruising levels or above an IFR flight level.    
for flights above FL410, the correlation beteen track direction and crusing level can be overriden by an ATC clearance or by the national AIP.

### IFR Flights Outside Controlled Airspace

cruising levels - IFR operating in level cruising flight outside of controlled airspace shall be flown at a cruising level appropriate to it track.   
This provision does not preclude the use of cruise climb techniques by ac in supersonic flight.

above FL410, other cruising levels may be flown, if authorised.

communications - IFR flight operating outside controlled airspace but within or into areas, or along routes, designated by the appropriate ATS Authority shall maintain an air-ground voice communication watch on the approprate communication channel and establish 2-way communication, as necessary, with the air traffic service unity providing Flight Information Service.

position reports - IFR flight operationg outside controlled airspace and required by the appropriates ATS Authority

* submit FPL
* maintain air-gorund voice communication watch on the appro channen and establish 2 way communication, as necessary with the air traffic service ... FIS AND MAKE POSITION REPROTS as if it was a controlled flight.

ac electing to use air traffic advisory srevice whilest operation IFR within specified advisory airspace are also expected to make position reports, ecept the flight plan and changes thereto are not subjected to clearances and that 2-way communication will be maintained with the unit providing the air traffic advisory service.

### EMERGENCY DESCENT

ATC 

+ broadcast by means of appropriate radio aides, or if not possible, request the appropriate commuincation stations immediately to bradcast an emergency message

OTHER AC    

it is expected that ac receiving such broadcast will clear the specified areas and stand by on the appropriate radio frequency for further clearances from the ATC unit

subsequent action by ATC

after emergency broadcast has been made, the ACC, Approach Unit, or aerodrome control tower concerned shall forward further clearances to all ac involved as to additional procedures to be followed during and subsequent to the emergency descent.   
THe ATS unit concerned shall additonally inform any other ATS units and control sectors which may be affected.


## Rules of the Air

Departures from Rules of the Air is ONLY PERMITTED in the interest of Flight Safety.

PRE-FLIGHT ACTION

before a flight, PIC to familiarise with ALL AVAIBLE information.   
For flights away from aerodrome, and for all IFR flights, CAREFUL STUDY of available weather reports and forecasts, taking into account fuel requirements, and alternative course of action if the flight cannot be complemented as planned.

SIMULATED INSTRUMENT FLIGHT

ac shall not be flown under simulated instrument flight conditions, i.e., with screens or equivalent, UNLESS    
* fully functioning dual controls are installed in the ac; AND
* a qualified pilot occupies a control-seat to as as SAFETY PILOT for the person flying under simulated instrument conditions.
* safety pilot shall have adequate vision forward and to each side of the ac, or a compentent observer in cummunication with the safety pilot shall occupy a position in the aircraft from which the observer's field of vision adequately supplements that of the safety pilot.

FLIGHT PLANS

a flight plan SHALL be SUBMITTED priort to operating   

* any flight or portion thereof to be provided with an air traffic control service;
* any IFR flight within advisory airspace;
* any flight within or into areas, or along routes designated by the competent authority, to facilitate the provision of flight information, alerting, and search and rescue services;
* any flight within or into areas, or along routes designated by the competent authority, fo facilitate coordination with appropriate military units or with air traffic srevices units in adjacent States in order to avoid the possible need for interception for the purpose of identification;
* any flight across international borders, unless otherwise prescribed by the States concerned; or
* any flight planned to operate at night, if leaving the vicinity of an aerodrome.

Note: not mandatory, but "highly recommended", file flight plans for flights over water greater than 10NM from the coast and/or flight over sparsely populated or remote terrain.

WHERE TO FILE FPL

FPL to be sumbitted BEFORE DEPARTURE to an air traffic service reporting office or, DURING FLIGHT, transmitted to the appropriate air traffic serves unit or air-ground control radio station, unless arrangements have been made for submission of repetititve flight plans.

WHEN TO FILE FPL

unless otherwise prescribed, a FPL for a flight to be provided with ATC service or air traffic advisory service shall be submitted AT LEAST 60 minutes before departure.

if submitted during flight, it must reach the appropreate air traffic services at least 10 minutes before the ac is estimated to reach    
* the intended point of entry into a control area or adisory area; or
* the point of crossing an airway or adisory route.

CONTENT OF FPL

ICAO FPL format

flight rules: I (IFR), V (VFR), Y (IFR changing to VFR), Z (VFR changing to IFR)    

crusing speed: TAS in km/hr, e.g. K0505 for 505km/hr) or knots, e.g. N0480kts for 480kts, or Mach number, e.g. M0750 for Mach 0.750. Changes in speed of more than 5% of TAS or more of M0.01 or more must be indicated.    

"estimated elapsed time" (EET) means time from take-off to     
* for IFR flights the time at which it is estimated that the ac will arrive over that designated point, defined by reference to navigation aids, from which it is intended that an instrument approach procedure will be commenced, or - if no navigation aid is associated with the aerodrome - the time at which the ac will arriver over the aerodrome.     
* for VFR flights, the time at which it is estimated that the ac will arrive over the aerodrome.     

ZZZZ if departure, alternate, or destination aerodromes do not have an ICAO location indicator, insert ZZZZ in the appropriate section and in Field 18 provide information DEP/..., DEST/..., or ALTN/... := ... aerodrome name


CHANGES TO A FLIGHT PLAN

IFR flight: ALL changes to the flight plan    
VFR flight operated as controlled flight: changes to be reports ASAP to appropriate air traffic service unit    
other (:= uncontrolled) VFR flight: significant changes to a flight plan shall be reported ASAP to appropriate ATSU

DELAY of 30 minutes in excess of estimated off-block time EOBT for a controlled flight    
DELAY of 60 minutes for an uncontrolled flight    
flight plan should be amended or a new FPL shall be submitted and the old plan cancelled whichever is applicable.



CLOSING A FPL

unless otherwise prescribed, a report or arrival shall be made in person, by RT, or via data link at the earliest possible moment after landing, to the appropriate ATS unit at the arrival aerodrome, by any flight for which a FPL was submitted covering the entire flight or the remaining portion of a flight to the destination aerodrome.

Note:     

* not required after landing on aerodrome with ATS AND radio communication or visual signals indicate that the landing has been observed.
* if flight plan submitted for portion of flight, other than the remaining portion of a flight to destination, it shall, when required, be closed by an appropriate report to the relevant ATS unit.
* when no ATSU exists at the arrival aerodrome, the arrival report, when required, shall be made as soon as practicable after landing and bu the quickest mens available to the nearest ATSU.

if COM facilities at arrival aerodrome are inadequate and alternate arrangements for the handling of arrival reports on the ground are not available:    
* immediately prior to landing - if practicable - transmit to the appropriate ATSU, a message comparable to an arrival report, where such a report is required.    
Normally, this transmission shall be made to the aeronautical station serving the ATSU in charge of the flight information region in which the ac is operated.

Arrival reports require the following:     

* aircraft identification
* departure aerodrome
* destination aerodrome (only in case of diversionary landing)
* arrival aerodrome
* time of arrival


EUR differences

* repetitive FPL may only be used for IFR flights operated regularly on the same day(s) of consecutive weeks and on at least 10 occasions or for flights on at least 10 consecutive days.
* flights subject to air traffic flow control, require flight plans to be submitted at least three hours in advance and any changes to EOBT in excess of 15 minutes requires the flight plan to be delayed or changed.



## Division of Airspace

### Classes of Airspace

        UPPER AIRSPACE
        controlled C
FIR
        LOWER AIRSPACE
                        controlled    control area CTA
                                      -> usually class A
                                      -> TMA, class A, D, or E
                                      
                                      control zone CTR
                                      -> class A, D, or E

                                      open FIR
                                      -> class G
                                      
FIR ~ 7 classes or airspace, A...G   
class determines the level of Air Traffic Service(s) and separation     

controlled airspace = ATC, i.e., class A (IFR only), B, C, D, and E (IFR and VFR)    
uncontrolled airspace => class F and G

controlled aerodromes (provide ATC service to aerodrome traffic) = must have control tower (according to ICAO)

```{r}

```

Essential traffic is that controlled traffic to which the provision of separation by ATC is applicable, but which, in relation to a particular controlled flight is not, or will not be, separated from other controlled traffic by the appropriate separation minimum.     
IFR to IFR in class A to E; and IFR to VFR in class B and C
VFR to VFR essential in class B

Essential traffic information shall be given to controlled flights concerned whenever they constitute essential traffic to each other.


### Airspace Class Boundaries

where airspace classes adjoin vertically, i.e., the one above the other, flights on the boundery level are treated as being in the less restrictive class of airspace.

In applying these criteria, Class B airspace is considered less restrictive than Class A airspace, B > C ....

### Typical Use of Airspace Clases

variations of applications; AIP => ENR

D is used for most CTAs and CTZs, i.e., allowing VFR flights

### Speed Control

unless otherwise notified speed is restricted to 250kt IAS below 10.000ft or FL100 in all classes of airspace except for IFR in classes A, B, and C, and VFR in class B

## Annex 11 - Air Traffic Services

Annex 11 - division of airspace & SARPS for ATS  

APPLICATION ~ where Contracting States provide air traffic services ATS SARPs apply, i.e., sovereign airspace and over high seas or undetermined sovereignty (and serviced by a specific CS).

standard := essential mandatory    
recommended practices := non-mandatory (i.e., expected)     
Annex 11 comprises a large number of recommended practices (non-mandatory) ~ regional variations to be notified to ICAO (and the world)

### Air Traffic Control Service ATC

units providing ATC are: area control centre ACC (service en-route flights), approach control office APP (service controlled flights during arrival or departure), and control Tower TWR (aerodrome traffic)

area control service (ACS) - can provide approach control service    
approach control sercice (APP) -> dedicated arrival/deprature servcice; can be offered by TWR or ACC    
aerodrome control service (TWR) -> tower, apron service may be assigned to a separate unit.

### Operation of Air Traffic Control Service

an ATC unit must    

* be provided with information on the intended movement of each aircraft, and with current information on the actual progress of each ac;
* determine from the information received, the relative positions of known ac to each other;
* issue clearances and information for the purpose of preventing collisions between ac under its control and of expediting and maintaining an orderly flow of air traffic;
* coordinate clearances as necessary with other unites
  + whenever an ac might otherwise conflict with traffic operated under the control of such other traffic
  + before transferring control of an ac to such other units.
  
UTC time used worldwide for ATS purposes; accurate to -/+ 30 secs.

### Separation of Aircraft

ATS := prevent collision of ac => vertical or horizontal separation

vertical separation to ac in cruise by procedrues specific to their area; e.g. semi-circular cruising levels at/below FL410, modified tables of cruising levels may be used above FL410.

horizontal separation is achieved by spacing ac laterally or longitudinally, or combination to horizontal and longitudinal.

regional agreements allow the use of both horizontal and vertical separation together, called composite separation.   
composite separation ~ horizontal and vertical requirements can be reduced bu never to less than half the standard values

separation minima are published in PANS-ATM with variations notified in reginal supplements.

### Longitudinal Separation

EUR - variation from ICAO standard longitudinal separation.

ac at level, climbing, or descending to be separated by 3 minutes, provided that     
+ progress is continously monitored by radar,
+ radar separation is never less than 20NM.

applying assigned mach number for ac on same track and level provided that
+ both ac are observed on radar and no interruption to the service is anticipated;
+ ac operating at assinged Mach numbers and the following ac is assinged the same or a lower Mach number than the lead

### ATC clearance

ALL controlled traffic subject to ATC clearance.   
ATC clearance is defined as "authorisation for an aircraft to proceed under conditions specified by ATC unit".

ATC clearances to ac in flight, and ac and vehicles on the ground.

ATC clearance should indicate:    

* ac identification (as shown in FPL)
* clearance limit
* route of flight
* level(s) of flight for the entire route or part thereof, and changes of levels if required; and
* any necessary instructions or information on the other matters such as approach or departure maneuvers, communications, and the time of expire of the cleaance.

### Responsibility of the Aircraft Commander (Pilot in Command)

ATC clearance should USUALLY be OBEYed, but it does not absolve the ac commander of his or her responsibility to comly with the rules of the air and safety of ac.    
Aircraft commander may advise ATC that the ac is unable to comly with a clearance and, in extreme cases, reject a clearance which is believed to be unsafe.   

When being radar vectored, an ATC clearance shoudl take into account obstacle clearance.

READING BACK CLEARANCES     
clearance should be read back, usually in FULL, so that receipt and understanding are confirmed.

unless specified by the authority, voice readback of CPDL messages is not required.

RADIO COMMUNICATIONS     
ac must maintain 2-way communication with current ATC unit whilst receiving a clearance from another unit which is further down the route.

COORDINATING ATC CLEARANCES     
responsibility for (en)route clearances lies with ACC in which flight begins.

ACC to coordinate clearance, in particular for flights about to shortly after take off leaving AOR (<30 minutes).

if (ever) coordination is incomplete and a clearance limit is reached, it is the responsibility of the PIC to obtain on-going clearance before proceeding beyojnd the clearance limit.

### Air Traffic Flow Management ATFM

ATFM in Europe to optimise the flow of air traffic.    
ATFM is available to all States in the EUR region.

ATFM may be applied to flights that      
+ take place in the EUR region
+ depart from the EUR region; or
+ enter the EUR region from an adjacent FIR.

Where ATFM is applied, there is a requirement to file flight plans well in advance and you may anticipate slot times to be issued for the departure.

Certain flights may be given priority over other flights, and certain flights may be exempt from the requirement to obtain a slot.

### Automatic Terminal INformation ATIS broadccasts

voice-ATIS or D-ATIS; D-ATIS transmitted to ac's FMS, electronic flight bag, or multi-function display

VOICE-ATIS ~ provided at busy aerodromes to reduce voice frequency load; typically    
* a single broadcast serving arriving ac; or
* a single broadcast serving departing ac; or
* one broadcast serving both, arriving and departing, ac; or
* two separate broadcasts on different frequencies serving arriving and depating ac respectively. Note: used when length of a single broadcast serviing both arriving and departing ac would be excessively long.

discrete VHF frequency - whenever practicable - to be used for voice-ATIS broadcasts.    
if no discrete VHF frequency available, the transmission may be on the voice channels of the most appropriate terminal NAVAID(s), preferably a VOR, provide the range and readability are adequate and the identification of the NAVAID is sequenced with the broadcast so that the latter is not obliterated.   
Voice-ATIS broadcasts will not be transmitted on the voice channel of an ILS.

Whenever voice-ATIS is provided, the broadcast should be continuous and repetitive, and is often also generated by text-to-speech software.   
It is recommended to not exceed 30 seconds.

CONTENTS OF ATIS BROADCAST    
* relate to a single aerodrome
* individual ATIS messages will be identified by a letter designator, e.g. "This is information GOLF, ..."
* information should be updated immediately when a significant change occurs, the identifyer is then changed to the next letter in the alphabet.
* ac must acknowledge receipt of the information upon establishing communication with ATS unit providing either the approach control service or aerodrome control service, as appropriate.
* when replying, the ATS unit need not retransmit any information contained in the ATIS to the ac except for the altimeter setting, which is always transmitted.
* if an ac acknowledges receipt of an ATIS that is not longer current, any element of information that needs updating shall be transmitted to the ac without delay.

## Emergency Procedures

**alterting service** := a service provided to notify appropriate organisations regarding airraft in need of search and rescue aid, and assist such organisation as required.   
Annex 11 sets out requirement for alerting service    
Annex 12 sets out search and rescue operations

### Service to Aircraft in the Event of an Emergency

aircraft to be known or believed in a state of emergency, including being subjected to unlawful interference, shall be given maximum consideration, assistance, and priority over other aircraft as may be cessitated by the circumstatnces.

A pilot may be expetcted to be contacted by ATS on 121.5MHz, or even 243.0MHz, in an emergency, assuming that communication attempts on the frequency in use have been unsucessful.

Aircraft equipped with an appropriate data link capability and/or an SSR transpointer might indicate an emergency, by operating the quipment as follows:

* Mode A, code 7700 := emergency or interception by a military ac
* Mode A, code 7500 := ac subject to unlawful interference
* activate the appropriate emergency capability of ADS
* transmit the appropriate emergency message via CPDLC.

### 3 Phases of Emergency

ATSU shall inform rescue coordination centers immediately when an ac is considered to be in a state of emergency according to 3 defined phases, or states of emergency:

* uncertainty phase ~ a situation where uncertainty exists as to the safety of an aircraft and its occupants;
* alert phase ~ a situation where apprehension exists as to the safety ofa an ac and its occupants; or
* distress phase ~ a situation where there is reasonable certainty that an ac and its occupants are threatened by grave and imminent danger or require immediate assistance.

Phases are initiated when certain set criteria are complied with.


## Altimeter Setting Procedures

```
CHECK FOR STANDARD Altimeter figure
```

ac flown at altitudes determined from an altimeter set to sea level pressure QNH when at or below the TRANSITION ALTITUDE. vertical position expressed in terms of altitude.

flights above transition altitude are performed along surfaces of constant atmospheric pressure baed on altimeter setting of 1013.25hPa (= mb) := flight levels.  
Flight levels are defined according to their height in feet in the standard atmosphere, e.g. 3500ft ~ FL35, 10.000ft ~ FL100.

where no transition altitude is established (e.g. remote areas outside FIRs), ac in the en-route phase MUST be flown at a flight level.

height above ground/AGL ~ QFE     Height    
height above mean sea level ~ QNH Altitude
height above standard pressure ~ QNE/1013.25hPa FL

altimeter settings provided to aircraft shall be rounded down to the nearest lower whole hectopascal.

### Transition Altitude TA

transition altitude is the altitude below which the vertical position of the aircraft is controlled by altitudes above mean sea level, i.e. QNH.

Transitiona altitude must normally be specified for each aerodrome by the State in which the aerodrome is located.   
In practice - and to avoid confusion - transitiona altitudes are normally standardised for the whole FIR.

Whereas the transition altitude is fixed, the transition level will change as the value of the QNH changes and ATC are responsible for calculating the transition level to be used.

The calculated height of the transition altitude is rounded up to the next full 1000ft, thus a calculated transition altitude (level?) of 33ooft will become 4000ft.

Transitional altitudes are published in the AIP and also shown on appropriate charts.

Transition altitude of an aerodrome shall be as low as possible, but not nromally less than 3000ft AGL.

### Transition Level TRL

change in reference from altitude on QNH to flight levels on 1013.2hPa is made when climbing, at the transition altitude.

when descending towards the transition altitude this is more difficult as the altimeters will be set to 1013.2hPa and the ac altitude may not be known.

To make things simple a transition level TRL, which is the lowest flight level available for use above the transition altitude, will be passed to a descending aircraft, normally as part of an approach or landing clearance, but can be requested by the pilot.   
An ac in descent must set QNH at the transition level.

Transition altitude := altitude at which the pilot in a climb changes altimeter setting from QNH to 1013.2hPa.    
Transition level := lowest flight level available for use above the transition altitude. = flight level at which the pilot in a descent changes altimeter setting from 1013.2hPa to QNH.  

### Transition Layer

transition layer := layer between transition altitude and transition level.

during passage of transition layer    
- vertical position expressed in terms of flight levels for ascending ac; and
- in terms of altitude for descending ac.

variations to this procedure exists in various countries:    
pilot in descending ac from FL to ALT, the pilot will change to the aerodrome QNH unless further flight level vacating reports have been requested by ATC, in which case the QNH will be set following the final flight level vacation report.

here ATCOs need to realise that the datum will have been changed, and be repared to act accordingly.

Pilots followin this procedure must be aware of the consequences in countries where this procedure is not standard, if the controller requires the ac to level before the cleared altituge is reached.    
For example, ac cleared to descend from FL100 to ALT 3000feet, transition level FL40.   => pilot will set QNH and commence descent.   
If controller subsequently requires the ac to level at FL60, the standard pressure setting must be reset!

## SSR Operating Procedures

SSR -> ac equipped with transponder -> reply to (ground) interrogation

Mode A  4096 numerical codes; 0-7    
Mode C  pressure altitude in 100ft/FL increments    
Mode S  transmits Mode A and "additional information" (e.g. ac identifier [callsign or registration], level information in 25ft increments, transponder capability and SI-code capability) := **elementary suveillance mode ELS**

**enhanced surveillance mode EHS** transmits additional ac parameters, e.g. rate of climb/descent, IAS, heading, track.

IDENT     
ATC instruction: SQUAWK xxxx (= select Mode A or IDENT) ~ instruction to be acknowledged by aircrew.

**airborne collision avoidance system ACAS** uses Mode S SSR equipment.

### Operation of Transponders

when ac carries serviceable transponder, aircrew to operate the transponder at all times during flight, regardless whether ac is within or outside airspace where SSR is used for ATS purposes.

Mode A ~ except in emergencies, communication failure, or unlawful interference:   

* operate transponder selcting on of the 4096 Mode A codes as individually directed by the ATC unit with which in contact;
* operate transponder on Mode A codes as prescribed on the basis of regional air navigation agreements; or
* in the absence of any ATC instructions or regional air navigation agreements, operate the transponder on Mode A Code 2000.

Mode C ~ to be operated continuously, unless otherwise instructed by ATC.

ATC may instruct to turn mode C off, if the reported flight level differes from the actual flight level by more than 300ft or 200ft in RVSM airspace (and also in some non-RVSM airspaces in Europe).

If mode C is operated and a pilot is asked to report the ac's altitude, the level must be reported to the nearest 100ft.   
E.g. ac at 17.278ft -> reported as FL173 (17.300ft)

Mode S ~ IFR traffic in Europe with a MTOM ? 5700kg or a maximum cruising of greater than 250kt MUST be equipped with Mode S EHS.    
Other IFR traffic must be Mode S ELS compliant.

Requirements for VFR traffic vary across States, usually Mode S ELS.

IDENT ~ pilot shall not squawk ident unless requested by ATC

Equipment -> older transponders allow to turn altitude reporting on and off, or select modes. Modern equipment is build to operate at its highest capability (e.g. responding to Mode A, Mode S, and Mode C interrogations as required) ALL THE TIME.   
Typically, pilot controls restricted to IDENT, OFF/STBY/ON, and number keypad for Mode A codes.

### Transponder Failure

in case of transponder failure, ATC units shall endeavour to provide for continuation of the flight to the destination aerodrome in accordance with the FPL.   
Pilot may, however, expect to comply with specific restrictions:

In case of transpoder failure BEFORE departure, pilots shall    

* inform ATS asap, preferably before submission of a flight plan;
* insert in Item 10/FPL under SSR the character "N" for complete unserviceability of the transponder, or, in case of partial transponder failure, the character corresponding to the remaining transponder capability;
* comply with any published procedures for seeking exemption from the requirements for carriage of a functioning SSR transponder; and
* if so required by the appropriate ATS authority, plan to proceed, as directly as possible, to the nearest suitable aerodrome where repain can be effected.


SSR equipment codes for Item 10/FPL:    
N ~ NIL    
A ~ transponder - Mode A "only"    
C ~ transponder - Mode A and C    
X ~ transponder - Mode S without identification or altitude information    
P ~ transponder - Mode S altitude, but no identification information    
I ~ transponder - Mode S identification, but no altitude information    
S ~ transponder "works" - Mode S with identification or altitude information    



## Emergencies

Mode A  7700  emergency, except when instructed by ATC to operate on specific code   
pilot may select 7700 whenever there is a specific reason to believe that this would be the best course of action.   
If an ac is intercepted by a military ac, the intercepted ac should set Mode A to code 7700.

Mode A  7600  ac experiencing two way radio communication failure.    

Mode A  7500  ac subjected to unlawful interference; unless situation warrants 7700

any of 770, 7600, or 7500 will trigger alarm at all radar units interrogating the ac's transponder.   
This alarm should indicate which emergency code has been selected.   
But if this is not clear, the ATCO my interogate each code in turn in order to verify which code has been selected.


### ACAS Equipment

ACAS/TCAS uses Mode S transponder to provide traffic information   

ACAS II provides collision avoidance commands in the vertical plane.    
so-called Resolution Advisories RA, are separate from and may conflict with ATC instructions.

Traffic Advisories TAs := ACAS advises on nearby, non-threatening traffic := "proximate traffic" ~ potentially threatening    
upon TA, aircrew to try to visually identify the ac that triggered TA and prepare for an ensuing RA.   

Displays: RA shown as RED SQUARE (and possibly vertical position related to ac, +01 = 100ft above).     
VSI    
showing RED := no go reaction; 
FLY TO GREEN (e.g. climb with rate between 1500 to 2000ft/min.)    
AUDIO: CLIMB CLIMB

Europe: all fixed wing turbine-engined ac with MTOM > 5700kg or capable of carrying more than 19 pax must be equipped with ACAS II.   
Additionally, many States and business aviation ac are equipped with ACAS. 



## ICAO Doc 4444 - Air Traffic Services

Doc 4444 - Procedures for Air Navigation Services - Air Traffic Management PANS-ATM.
PANS-ATM is complementary to Annex 2 SARPs (Rules of the Air) and Annex 11 (Air Traffic Services).

### Applicability

Strictly speaking: States are NOT OBLIGED to comply with PANS-ATM ~ most do.

PANS-ATM specifies in greater detail the actual procedures to be applied by ATSUs.   
PANS-ATM procedures are supplemented where necesary by regional procedures.

PANS-ATM mainly directed at ATCOs, attention of pilots should be drawn to the portions that affect pilots/direct interest to them.

### Terrain Clearance

Annex 11 defines the objectives of ATS NOT TO INCLUDE prevention of collision with terrain.   
PANS-ATM do not relieve the pilot of his responsibilities of ensuring that any clearance issued by ATC are safe in this respect, ecept when an IFR flight is vectored by radar (radar minimum safe altitude)

### ATFM Service

ATFM ~ ensures that the number of flights does not exceed capacity of ATS.    

ATCU to inform other ATCUs about constraints (cannot accept additional traffic or only at certain entry rate).

Pilots of ac detined to the location or area in question, and operators known or believed to be concerned, must also be advised of the delays expected of the restrictions that will be applied.

### Submission of a FPL

except of arrangements for the submission of repetitive flight plans, a flight plan submitted prior to departure should be submitted to ATS reporting office at the departure aerodrome.   
If no such unit exists at the departure aerodrome, the flight plan should be submitted to the unit serving or designated to serve the departure aerodrome.

ICAO Annex 2 (rules of the air) requires flight plans to be submitted 60 minutes before departure (Europe 3 hours).   
In case of a delay of 30 minutes in excess of the EOBT for a controlled flight (or 60mins for uncontrolled flight for which FPL was submitted), FPL to be amended or a a new FPL while old FPL cancelled (whichever is applicable).

Repetitive FPL may be filed for identical flights taking place on the same day, days of consecutive weeks, and/or occur on at least ten occasions, or takel place on at least ten consecutive days.

European region: More restrictions on repetivite FPLS ~ EUR SUPPS, section 2.

### Clearances and INformation

clearances are based on known traffic conditions   -> ac in air, ac and vehicles, and  obstruction on maneuvering area and under control by ATC

ATC clearance not suitable to the PIC, PIC may request if applicable to obtain an mended clearance.

receipt of a clearance does not constitute authority to violate any applicable regulations.  

*Cleared via flight plan route* may be used to describe any route, or portion thereof, provided it is the same as that filed in the (last) FPL and that sufficient routing details are given to etablish the ac on its route.

*cleared via (designation) departure* or *cleared via (designaion) arrival* may be used when standard departure or arrival routes have been established by the appropriate ATS authority and published in the AIP.

### Multi-Stage Flights

FPL for multi-state flight with one or more intermediate stops.   
Initial clearance limit will be no further than the first destination aerodrome.   
New clearances must be obtained for each subsequent leg.

### Content of ATC Clearance

ATC to include (in order listed):    

* aircraft identification
* clearance limit
* route of flight
* level for either the entire route of for part of it and level changes if required
* instructions or other information about SSR, approach or departure procefures, communications, and the time of expiry of the clearance. If expiry time is given, the ac is not airborne by that time, a new clearance must be obtained.

E.g. London centre clears Easy443 to destination as filed, request level changes en-route.   
Bogeyair, direct SAM then ORTAC, maintain FL410. Clearance limit ORTAC, delays in xxx airspace.



### Reading Back ATC Clearances

clearance must be read back to the ATCO to confirm correct reception.   
Readback is verbatim, but the following items must always be read back

* ATC route clearances,
* clearances to enter, land-on, take-off from, hold short of, cross, taxy, or backtrack on any runway
* runway in use
* altimeter setting
* SSR codes
* level, heading, and speed instructions.

### Changes to FPL

whenissueing a clearance covering a requested change in flight plan route or cruising level, ATC must specify the exact nature of the change in the clearance.

If a level change is involved and more than one level is contained in the flight plan, all such levels must be included in the clearance.

ATCU may ask an ac to temporarily change its call sign for safety reasons when there is a risk of confuston between two or more similar call signs.

### Postion Reports

on routes defined by designated significant points, position reports must be made when over, or as soon as possible after passing, each desgnated compulsory reporting point, unless position reporting is not required.

Additional reports over other points may be requested by the appropriate air traffic services unit when so required or air traffic services purposes.

Position report should contain the following elements:

* ac identification
* position
* time
* flight level or altitude
* next position and time over
* ensuring significant point

Qanta 010A, KEMPTEN 52, FL390, estimate TANTO01, KARLSRUHE next

Flight level or altitude may be omitted on the instructions of ATC when SSR mode C information can be made continuously availbale to controllers in a labelled form, and when adepquate procedures have been developed to guarantee the safe and efficient use of SSR Mode C information.

All the last three element may be omitted from position report when so prescribed on the basis of regional air navigation agreements.

Flight level or altitude shall however be included in the initial call after changing to a new frequency.

Regional authorities may exempt certain flights completely fomr the requirement to make position reports.   
This is now normal when receiving a radar service.

### Change from IFR to VFR Flight

change form IFT to VFR is only acceptable when a message initiated by the PIC containing **cancelling my IFR flight** together with the changes, if any, to be made to his current flight plan, is received by an air traffic services unit.

No invitation to change from IFR to VFR is to be made by ATC either directly or by inference. 

No reply, other than the acknowledgement "IFR cancelled at <<time>>" should be normally made by an air traffic services unit.

When ATC are aware that IMC is likely to be encoutered along the route of flight, a pilot changing from ifR to VFR should, if practicable, be so advised.

### Wake Turbulence Categories

wake turbulence separation minima is based on a grouping of ac types into four categories according to the maximum certificated take-off mass:

* SUPER (J)   A380-800
* HEAVY (H)   ac of 136.000kg or more
* MEDIUM (M)  ac of less than 136.000kg, but more than 7000kg
* LIGHT (L)   ac of 7000kg or less

H,M,L to be entered as wake turbulence category in the FPL.

### Cruising Levels

except when specifically authorised by the appropriate authority, cruising levels below the minimum flight altitudes established by the State MUST NOT BE ASSIGNED.

minimum sector altitude MSA is calculated ensuring at least 300m/984ft clearance above the highest obstacle within 25NM of VOR, DME, or airfield.

Unless otherwise prescribed by the State concerned, the lowest usable flight level is that flight level which corresponds to, os is immediately above the established minimum flight altitude.

For flight in the vicinity of aredromes and wihtin terminal control areas, the vertical position of aircraft shall be expressed in terms of altitude at or below the transition altitude and interms of flight levels at or above the transition level.   
While passing through the trtainsiton layer, vertical position shall be expressed in terms of flight levels when climbing or in terms of altitudes when descending.

assignment of cruising levels ~ ac flying in the same direction shall be assigned in a manner that will be correct for an approach sequence t destination.

speed control ~ ATC may instruct ac to modify their speed either in the en-route or approach stages.   
At of above FL250: speed adjustments in increments of 0.01 Mach    
Below FL250: speed adjustments in increments of 10kt IAS.   
For turbine powered ac, speed reductions below 250kt may be rejected by the pilot for "good reason" (flight safety, operational performance limits/maeuverability/safe speeds)

Under radar control and on final approach speed adjustments will be limited to a maximum of 20kt.   
ONce within 4NM of the threshold on the approach no further speed adjustments should be given.


## Separation

controlled traffic is separated either vertically, horizontally, or by a combination of the two using no less than half of each criteria known as composite separation.

separation must be provided    

* between all flights in Class A and B
* between IFR flights in Class C, D, and E
* between IFR flights and VFR flights in Class C
* between IFR flights and Special VFR flights; and
* between Special VFR flights, when required by ATC, except in D and E during the hours of the daylight when flights have been cleared to climb or descend subject to maintaining own separation and remaining in VMC

procedural control := separation may be estalished by applying procedures which do not require radar surveillance, or     
radar control := by observing position of the ac on the radar screen.

procedural separation always involves greater distances between ac than radar separation.

### Procedural Separation

vertical separation obtained by requiring ac using prescribed altimeter setting procedures to operate at different levels or altitudes.

minimum vertical separation is:   

* within RVSM airspace between FL290 and FL410 inclusive: 1000ft
* below FL290: 1000ft, 
* above FL290 in non-RVSM airspace: 2000ft

vertical separation during climb or descent: pilot in direcet communication with each other may, with their concurrence, be cleared to maintain a specified vertical separation between their ac during climb or descent.     
When an ac will pass through the level of another ac on the same track, the following longitudinal separation shall be provide:   

* 15 minutes while vertical separation does not exist;
* 10 minutes while vertical separation does not exist WHEN NAVAIDS permit the frequent determination of position; or
* 5 minutes while vertical separation does not exist provided that the level change is commenced within 10 minutes of the time the 2nd ac has reported over an exact reporting point.

an ac may be assigned a level previously occupied by another ac after the latter has reported vacating it.   
if using SSR Mode C, the controller considers a lavel vacated, if it indicates a change in the anticipated direction from its previously assigned level of more than 300ft.

An ac may be cleared to a level previously occupied by another ac after the latter has reported vacating it, except when:   

* severe turbulence is known to exist;
* the higher ac is effecting a cruise climb; or
* the difference in ac performance is such that less than the applicable separation minimum may result.

In such cases, the clearance shall be withheld unti the ac vacating the level has reported at or passing another level separated by the required minimum.   
ac wishing to dscent to FL150 with another one below it wishing to descend to FL140:    
in severe turbulenes: no cleard to leave FL150 until lower ac has cleared FL130.

### Horizontal Separation

lateral & longitudinal

lateral separation of ac at the same level is obtained by requiring them to operate on different tracks or in different locations.    
longitudinal separation is achieved by timing.

lateral separation can be achieved    

* by using the same or different geographic locations, sometimes called geographic separation;
* by position reports which positively indicate the ac are over different geographic locations as determined visually or by reference to a NAVAID; or
* by requiring ac to fly on specified tracks which are separated by a minimum amount appropriate to the NAVAID or method emplowed.

using VORs: lateral separation based on VOR navigation requires ac to be separated by at 15 degrees and be 15NM or more from the beacon     
using NDBs: lateral separation based on NDB navigation: 30 degrees and at least 15NM from NDB.     
using (dead recogning) DR navigation: lateral separation based on DR requires ac to be established on tracks diverging by at least 45 degrees at a distance of 15NM or more from the point of the intersection of the tracks, this point being determined either visuall or by reference to a NAVAID.

using RNAV: lateral separation based on RNAV achieved by establishing ac on traccks which diverge by at least 15 degrees.    
Lateral separation exists when the protected airspace associated with the track of one ac does not overlap with the proteted airspace associated with the track of another ac.   
This is determined by applying the angular difference between the two tracks and the appropriate protected airspace value.   
The derived value is expressed as a distance from the intersection of the tow tracks at which lateral separation exists.

DME/GNSS separation ~ DME or GNSS can be used in conjunction with other NAVAIDs and with direct controller/pilot communications.

aircraft at same level -> same track separation is 20NM provided each ac uses on-track DME stations or DME station co-located with a waypoint or the same waypoint when both ac are using GNSS and separation checked by obtinaing simultaneous DME and/or GNSS readings from the ac at frequent intervals.
This can be reduced to 10NM provided that the leading ac maintains a TAS of 20kt or faster than the trailing ac.

ac on crossing tracks the longitudinal separation applies provided each ac reports its distance from the station located at the crossing point of the tracks and the angle between the tracks is less than 90 degrees.

aircraft climbing or descending on the same track -> while vertical separation does not exist 10NM separtion is required provided each ac utilises "on-track" DME stations, an "on-track" DME station co-located with a waypoint or the same waypoint when both ac are utilising GNSS, one ac maintains a level and separation is established by obtaining simultaneous DME/GNSS reading from the ac.

ac utilising on-track DME an/or co-located waypoint or same waypoint may be cleared to climb or descend through the levels occupied by other ac and/or co-located waypoint or same waypoint, provided that tit has been positviely established that the ac have passed each other and are at least 10NM apart, or such other value prescribed by the appropriate ATS authority.

longitudinal separation estbliahed by requiring ac to depart at a specified time, to lose time to arrive over a geographical location at a specified time, or to hold over a gropgraphical location until a specified time.

For ac on the same track at the same cruising level the timed separation minima are    
* 15 minutes
* 10 minutes if NAVAIDS permit frequent determination of position and speed;
* 5 mins is preceeding ac 20kt or more faster, both ac departing from same aerodrome or reporting point;
* 3 mins, if preceeding ac is 40kt or more faster, and ac departing from same aerodrome or reported over same reporting point.

When an ac is to climb or descend through another's track, there must be 15 minutes of longitudinal separaion.   
This can be reduced to 10 minutes when NAVIDS permit frequent position determination, or 5 minutes if close to an exact reporting point.


LONGITUDINAL SEPARATION IN EUROPE ~ variation from ICAO.

ac at level, climbing, or descending, to be separated by 3 minutes provided that    
+ their progress is continuously monitored by radar; and
+ their radar separation is never less than 20NM.

reduction in separation in vicinity of aerodrome => separation in the vicinity of aerodromes reduced, if      
+ adequate separation can be provided by the aerodrome control tower when each ac is continously visible to the controller;
+ each ac is continuously visible to the flight crews of the other ac concerned and the pilots thereof report that they can maintain their own separation; or
+ if one ac follows another flight, the flight crew of the succeeding ac reports that the other ac is in sight and separation can be maintained.

### RNP

longitudinal and lateral distance-based separation minima in a RNP RNAV environment are    
+ RNP10 50NM
+ RNP4  30NM
+ otherwise 80NM with ac reporting distance "on track" from the same waypoint and separation is checked by obtaining simultaneous RNAV distance readings from the ac at frequent intervals to ensure that the minimum will not be infringed.

### Radar Separation

except under the special conditions of independent and dependent parallel approaches, the standard horozontal radar separation mimium is 5NM.   
This may be reduced to 3NM when radar capabilities at a given location permit.

Further reduction to 2.5NM may be applied between succeeding ac established on the same approach track subject to average runway occupancy time, braking action, radar rate of update, wake turbulence separation, etc.

### Clearance to Maintain Own Separation While Maintaining VMC

if requested by an ac and provided it is agreed by the pilot of the other ac, and so authorised by the appropriate ATS authority, an ACC may clear a controlled flight operating in airspace clases D an E in daylight VMC to maintain own separation to one other ac and remain in VMC.

When a controlled flight is cleared, the clearance shall be for a specified portion of the flight at or below 10.000ft, during climb or descent and subject to gurther restrictions as and when prescribed on the basis of regional air navigation agreements.


### Essential traffic information

**essential traffic** is controlled traffic not separated from other controlled traffic by the prescribed separation minima.   
ATC must advise both aircraft of    
+ direction of flight of the other ac concerned;
+ type of ac concerned; and
+ cruising level of the ac concerned and estimated time over the reporting point nearet to where the level will be crossed.


## Approach Control Service

### General Procedures for Departing Aircraft

transfer from TWR to ACS    

* when VMC in the vicinity of the aerodrome
  + prior to ac leaving vicinity of the aerodrome; or
  + prior to ac enterin IMC
* when IMS in the vicinity of the aerodrome
  + immediately before the ac entering runway in use for take-off; or
  + immediately after the ac is airborne, if local procedures require
  
Departing ac may be expedited by suggesting a take-off direction which is not into the wind.   
responsibility of PIC to accept and making such take-off or wait for normal take-of in a preferred direction.

### Clearances for Departing Aircraft

if air traffic control is based on tracks, ATC clearances must specify direction of take-off and turn after take-off, track to be made good before proceeding on desired heading, level to maintain before continuing climb to cruising level, time, point and/or rate at which level change shalle be made, and any other necessary maneuver consistent with safe operation of ac.

### Separation of Departing Aircraft

minimum separation between departing aircraft:    

* 1 minute, if ac fly on tracks diverging by at least 45 degrees.    
  minimum may be reduced for ac using parallel runways or diffrent runways with divergin directions provided they do not cross, and provided instructions covering the procedures have been approved by the appropriate ATS Authority, and lateral separation is effected immediately after take-off.
* 2 minutes, if preceeding ac is 40kt or more faster than following ac, and both ac follow same track.
* 5 minutes while vertical separation does not exist if a departing ac will be flown through the level of a preceding departing ac and both ac follow the same track.

### Information for Departing Aircraft

information regarding **significant changes** in meteorological conditions in the take-off and climb-out area obtained by the unit providing approach control service after a departing ac has established communiation with such unit, shall be tranmitted without delay, ecept when it is known that the ac has already received the information.

significant changes include surface wind direction or speed (note: magnetic wind direction is given for take-off and landing).

information regarding operational status of visual or non-visual aids essential for take-off and climb shall be transmitted without delay/unless known.

information on **essential local traffic** known to ATC

### General Procedures for Arriving Aircraft

responsibility for control of arriving ac shall be transferred from the unit providing approach control service to TWR when the ac    

* is in the vicinity of the aerodrome, and it is considered that it will be able to complete its approach and landing in visual reference to the ground, or it has reached uninterrupted VMC; or
* has landed.

... whichever is the earliest.

Arriving ac may be required to report when leaving or passing a reporting point or when starting procedures turn or base turn, or to provid other information required by the controller to expedite departing ac.

Significant changes to weather and aids during departure will be notficed to the ac asap.

### Separation of Departing and Arriving Aircraft

except otherwise prescribed, separation shall be applied when take-off clearance is based on the position of arriving ac:

if arriving ac is making a complete instrument approach, a departing ac may take-off:    
* in any direction until an arriving ac has started its procedure turn or base turn leading to final approach; or
* in a direction which id sidderent by at least 45 degrees from the reciprocal of the direction of approach after the arriving ac has started its procedure turn or base turn leading to final approach, provided that the take-off will be made at least 3 minutes before the arriving ac is estimated over the beginning of the instrument runway

if an arriving ac is making a straight-in approach, a departing ac may take-off:   
* in any direction until 5 minutes before arriving ac is estimated over instrument runway;
* in any direction which is different by at 45 degrees from the reciproval of the direction of the approach of the arriving ac
  + until 3 minutes before the arriving ac is estimate over the beginning of the runway; or
  + before the arriving ac crosses a designated fix on the approach track.
  
**own separation** ~ when requested by the ac and if so prescribed by the appropriate ATS Authority an arriving ac may be cleared to descent subjet to maintaining own separation and remaining in VMC, if reports indicate this is possible.

### Visual Approach

IFR flight may be cleared to execute a isual approach provided that the pilot can maintain visual reference to the trerrain and:    
* reported ceiling is at or above the approved initial approach level for the ac so cleared; or
* the pilot reports at the intial approach level or at any time during instrument approach peocedure that the meteorological conditions are such that with reasonable assurance a visual approach and landing can be completed.

Separation myst be provided between an ac cleared to execute a visual approach and other arriving and departing ac.


---- ac    | reported ceiling above approach level
        --
          ------> MET conditions allow visual approach
          
Instrument approaches must be conducted in accordance with IFR even if the aircraft is in VMC.     
However, the PIC may request a clearance to continue for a visual approach.

applies also to successive visual approaches, until the pilot reports having the preceding ac in sight, upon which he/she shall then be instructed to follow and maintain own separation from the precedin ac.

When both ac HEAVE WTC, or the preceding ac is heavier WTC than the following, and the distance between the ac is less than the appropriate wake turbulence minimum, the controller shall issue a caution of possible wake turbulence.

PIC of ac concerned shall be responsible for ensuring that the spacing from a preceding ac of a heavier wake turbulence category is acceptable.   
If additional spacing is required, the flight crew shall inform ATC accordingly, stating their requirements.


### Instrument Approach

PIC reports or it is clearly apparant to ATC that crew is not familiar with an instrument approach procedure, the initial approach level, the point (in minutes from the appropriate reporting point) at which the procedure turn will be started, the level at which the procedures turn shall be carried out, and the final approach track shall be specified, except that only the last-mentioned need be specified if the ac is to be cleared for a straight in approach.    
The missed approach procedures shall be specified when deemed necessary.

A *timed approach procedure* may be used, as necessary, in order to expedite the approaches of a number of arriving ac. 
In a timed approach procedure ac are requested to pass a specified point inbound at a notified time.

If visual reference to terrain is established before the approach procedures is complete, the pilot must continue with the full procedure unless he or she requests and is cleared for a visual approach.

### Holding

holding and holding pattern entry shall be accomplished in accordance with procedures established by the approiate ATS Authority and published in the relevant AIP.    
If entry and holding procedures have not been published or if the procedures are not known to the PIC, the appropriate ATC unit shall describe the procedures to be followed.

Levels at holding points should be assigned so that -- normally the first ac to arrive over a holding point  should be at the lowest level, with following ac at successively higher levels. <--> stack!

### Approach Sequence

approach sequence ~ facilitate maximum number of arrivals with least average delay.   

Special priority may be given    

* an ac with anticipates being compelled to land because of factors affecting the safe operation of the ac (engine failure, shortage of fuel, etc); or
* hospital ac or ac carrying any sick or seriously injured person requiring urgent medical attention.

If pilot in an approach sequence has indicated an intention to hold for weather improvement, or for other reasons, such action shall be approved.    
However, when other holding ac indicate intention to continue their approach-to-land and if alternative procedures involving, for instance, the use of radar are not available, the pilot desiring to hold will be cleared to an adjacent fix for holding awaiting weather change or rerouting.    
Alternatively, the ac should be given a clearance to place it at the top of the approach sequence so that other holding ac may be permitted to land.

Coordination shall be effected with the area control centre when required to avoid conflict with the traffic under the jurisdiction of this centre. The ac operator, or a designated representative, shall be advised of the action taken immediately after the clearance is issued, if practicable.


### Expected Approach Time

**expected approach time** is the time at which ATC expects that an arriving ac, following a delay, will leave the holding point to complete its approach for a landing.

EAT will be determined for an arriving ac that will be subjected to a *delay of 10 minutes of more*.   
EAT must be transmitted to the ac asap and not later than at the commencement of its initial descent from cruising level.

If ac is expected to *hold for 30 minutes or more*, the EAT must be transmitted by the most expeditious means.    

A revised EAT must be transmmitted to the ac without delay whenever EAT changes by 5 minutes or more.

If the holding point to which the EAT refers is not obvious, it should be specified.

### Information for Arriving Aircraft

arriving ac shall asap establish communiation with approach controle unit

to be transmitted, unless known to have already received:

* runway in use;
* meteorological information (magnetic wind direcetion is given for take-off and landing)
* current ruwnay sufrace conditions; and
* changes in observed RBR or other measure of visibility.

At the commencement of the final approach, the following information shall be transmitted:     
* significant changes in the mean surface wind direction and speed;
* latest information, if any, on wind shear and/or turbulence in the final approach area; and
* current visibility.

wind direction is normally "TRUE", but ATC will always give the surface wind in "MAGNETIC

### Final Approach

During final approach the following information shall be transmitted without delay:

* sudden occurrence of hazards (e.g. unauthorised traffic on the ruwnay);
* significant variations in the currrent surface wind, expresssed in terms of minimum and maximum values, significant changes are
  + mean headwind component: 10kt
  + mean tailwind component: 2 kt
  + mean crosswind component: 5kt
* significant changes in runway surface conditions;
* changes in the operational status of required visual or non-visual aids; and
* changes in observed RVR value(s), in accordance with the reporte scale in use, or changes in the visibility representative of the direction of approach and landing.

### Inability to Comply with Procedure

PIC advises on inability to comply with the approach control holding or communication procedures, the alternative procedures should be approached if known traffic conditions permit.



## Aerodrome Control Service

### Functions of Aerodrome Control Tower

TWR -> information and clearance for safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic on and in the vicinity of an aerodrome with the objective to prevent collision(s) between:    

* aircraft flying in the aerodrome traffic circuits 
* aircraft operating on the maneuvering area;
* aircraft landing and taking-off;
* aircraft and vehicles operationg on the maneuvering area; or
* aircraft on the maneuvering area and obstractions on that area.

### Alerting Service Provided By Aerodrome Control Tower

TWR responsible for altering the safety services and must immediately report any failure or irregularity of operation in any apparatus, lgiht, or other device established at an aerodrome for the guidance of aerodrome traffic and PICs of ac.

Aircraft with fail to report after having been handed over  to the TWR, or, having once reported, cease radio contant, and in either case fail to land five minutes after the expected landing time, must be reported to the area control center or flight information center.

### Suspension of VFR Operations

in case of suspension of VFR operations, TWR    

* hold all departure other than those which file an IFR flight plan and obtain approval thereof from the aera control center;
* recall all local flights operating under VFR or obtain approval for special VFR operations;
* notify the area control center of the action taken; and
* notify all operators of the reason for taking such action, if necessary or requested.

### Information on Local Traffic

information on local traffic shall be issued either directly or through the unit providing approach control service when, in the judgement of the TWR controller, such information is necessary in the interests of safety, or when requested by aircraft.

### Information on Aerodrome Conditions

essential information on aerodrome conditions includes information on the following:    

* construction or maintenance work on, or immediately adjacent to the movement area;
* rough or broken surfaces on a runway, a taxiway, or an apron, whther marked or not;
* snow, slush, or ice on the runway, taxiway, or an apron;
* water on a runway, taxiway, or an apron;
* snow banks or drifts adjacent to a ruwnay, taxiway, or an apron;
* other temporary hazards, including parked ac and birds on the ground or in the air; and
* failure or irregular operation of part or all of the aerodrome lighting system; or any other pertinent information.

### ATIS

aerodrome information may be provided by a voice ATIS as a continuous or repetitive transmission.   
A discrete VHF frequency is used whenever practicable, but, if one is not available, the transmission may be made on the voice channel of an appropriate terminal vavigation aid, preferably a VOR, but not on the voice channel of the ILS.

information must relate to only 1 aerodrome.   
information must be updated immediately given a significant change.    
Preparation and dissemination of the ATIS message is the responsibility of ATS.    
ATIS broadcast should, whenever practicable, not exceed 30 seconds.

Individual ATIS messages are identified by a designator in form of a letter of the ICAO spelling alphabet, in alphabetical order.   
Ac to acknowledge receipt of information upon establishing communication with ATS unit providing approach control srevice or aerodrome control service, as appropriate.   
When acknowledging receipt, ATS unit will confirm the altimeter setting but isnot required to repeat any other information unless the ATIS message received is out of datae and then only the elements which have changed will be transmitted to the ac.

When rapidly changing meteorological conditions make it inadvisable to inclde a weather report in the ATIS, the TIS message will indivate tha the relevant weather information will be given on initail contact iwth the appropriate ATS unit.


### Control of Aerodrome Traffic

ac landing or in the final stages of an approach to land shall normally have priority over an ac intending to depart.

Priority for landing will be given to 

* emergency
* hospital flight;
* search and rescue ac on operation.

Clearance to land or any alternative clearance received from the aerodrome controller, or - when applicable - the procedural controller should normally be passed to the ac before it reaches a distance of 4km(2NM) from touchdown.

If an ac enters the circuit without permission and indicats that it wishs to land, it must be allowed to do so.   
In particular, controllers should be aware that ac experiencing an emergency might enter the circuit without permission and they should be ready to offer assistance.

Departure shall normally be cleared in the order in which they are ready for take-off, except that deviations may be made from this order of priority to facilitate the maximum number of departures with the least average delay.

Landing ac priority over take-offs!

### Control of Departing Aircraft

departing ac will not be permitted to commence take-off until the preceding departing ac has crossed the end of the runway in use or has started a turn or until all preceding landing aircraft are clear of the runway in use.

In the interest of expediting air traffic, a clearance for immediate take-off may be issued to an aircraft before it enters the runway.    
On acceptance of such clearrance the ac shall taxy out to the ruwnay and take-off in one continuous movement.

Independent parallel departures may be conducted from parallel runways provided there is suitable surveillance readar available capable ofidentifying ac within 1NM from the end of the runway.

### Control of Arriving Aircraft

landing ac will not be permitted to cross the beginning of the runway on its final approach until the preceding departing ac has crossed the end of the runway in use, or has started a turn, or unitl all preceding ladning ac are clear of the runway in use.


## ATC Surveillance Service

ATC surveillance service of air traffic from either radar or automatic dependent surveillance ADS.

radar ~ primary radar/surveillance (reflections / echo principle)   
secondary radar/surveillance ~ active response from ac transponder

ADS transmits, as a minimum: GPS position, speed, height and heading.   
ADS-B (broadcast) ~ basis data unsolicited on SSR reply frequency to whoever can receive    
ADS-C (controct) ~ datalink service transmitting additional information, including clearance requests and messages. ATC can reply through datalink with clearances and control message,(voiceless control)

### Radar System Capabilities

radar ~ high level of reliability, availability, and integrity; back-up facilities are always provided.

Radar services are restricted to specific areas of coverage within line-of-sight of the radar transmitter.   
Thus, remote areas are unlikely to provide a radar service and air traffic will be procedural control.

When ATC is equipped with/using PSR, the pilot of a departing ac can expect his ac to be identified within 1 NM of the departure end of runway.

### Minimum Radar Information

minimum radar information displayed to controller is

* radar position indications;
* radar map information; and
* information from SSR Mode A, Mode C, and MOde S, when available.

### Identification of Aircraft

ac must be radar identified and the pilot informed before a radar service can be provided. Radar identification is achieved using SSR by

* use of a radar identification label;
* setting a specific code; or
* using the IDENT feature.

using PSR by    
* correlating radar position with ac reported position;
* transfer of radar identification;
* observing ac reported maneuvers; or
* instructing the ac to change haeding by 30 degrees or more.

The term radar contact is used by a controller to an aircraft means that the aircraft has been positively identified on radar, but it does not mean that the radar controller is offering an specific service.   
Before offering a service the radar controller must confirm that the ac has been positively identified on radar and he must also confirm the type of srevice given.

### Position Information

An ac provided with radar service should be informed of its position in the following circumstances:   

* upon identification, except when the identification is established:
  + based on the pilot's report of the ac position or withini on NM of the runway upon departure and the observation is consistent with the ac's time of departure;
  + by use of assigned discrete SSR codes or Mode S and the location of the ac observed radar position indication is consistent with the currrent flight plan of the ac; or
  + by transfer of radar identification;
  + on request;
* when a pilot's estimate differes significantly from the readar controller's estimation based on radar observation;
when the pilot is instructed to resume own navigation after radar vectoring if current instructions had diverted the ac form a prviously assigned route; or
* immediately before termination of radar srevice, if the ac is observed to deviate from its intended route.


ATC advises pilots that they have radar contact to confirm that the radar identity of the ac has been established.

Postion information will be passed to ac in one  of the following forms:

* well-known geopgraphical position
* magnetic track and distance to a significant point, an enroute NAVAID, or an approach aid;
* direction (using points of compasses) and distance from a known position;
* distance to touchdown, if the ac is on final approach; or
distance and direction fromthe center line of an ATS route.

### Strayed and Unidentified Aircraft

**strayed aircraft** ~ an ac which has deviated significantly fom it sintended track or reports that it is lost;     
**unidentified aircraft** ~ an aircraft which has been observed or reported to be operating in a given area but whose identity has not been established.

### Radar Vectoring

radar vectoring ~ giving pilot specific headings to maintain a desired track.

when vectoring

* whenever practicable - vectoring along routes or tracks on which pilot can monitor ac position with reference to NAVAIDs
* when vector divert from previously assigned route, provide information unless self-evident
* ac shall not be vectored closer than 2.5NM from limit of airapsce for which radar controller is responsible, unless local arrangements exist or transfer to adjacent sector
* controlled flights not be vectored into uncontrolled airspace ecept in emergency or to circumnavigate sever weather, or at request of pilot
* when vectoring IFR flight, the radar controller shall issue clearances such that the prescribed obstacle clearance will exist at all times until the ac reaches the point where the pilot will resum own navigation.

When terminating radar vectoring, the radar controller shall instruct the aircrew to resume own navigation, given the ac's position and appropriate instructions as necessary, if vectoring diverted ac from previously assigned route.

### Radar Vectoring to ILS

vectors ~ magnetic headings to maintain the desired track.    
Final vector to enable ac to be established in level flight on final approach track prior to intercepting the specified or nominal glide path, if an ILS or radar approach is to be made, and should provide an intercept angle with the final approach track of 45 degrees of less

When independent parallel approaches are being used, the maximum intercept angle is 30 degrees and the ac should be established on the center line at least 2NM before glideslop intercept.

### Surveillance Radar Approaches

surveillance radar approaches are normally terminated at 2NM from touchdown or before an ac enters an area of permanent radar clutter.   
When authorised, surveillance radar appaoches may be continued to the threshold of the runway, or a prescribed point less than 2NM from touchdown.   
Distance and level information should be given at each 0.5NM.

During a surveillance radar approach:    
* distance and level information should be given at each 0.5 NM;
* transmission should not be interrupted for intervals of more than 5 seconds while ac is within a distance of 4NM from touchdown; and
* radar controller should not be responsible for any duries other than those directly connected with a particular approach.

An ac making a radar approach should be directed to exectue a missed approach, if    
* ac appears to be dangerously positioned on final approach; or
* for reasons involving traffic conflcitions;
* if no clearance to land has been received from the no-radar controller  at 2NM from touchdown or such distance has been agreed with the TWR; or
* on instructions from the aerodrome controller.

An ac making a radar approach should be advised to consider executing a missed approach in the following circumstances:   

* when the ac reaches a position from which it appear that a successful approach cannot be completed;
if the ac is not visiable on the radar dispaly for any significant interval during the last 2NM of the approach; or
* if the position of the ac is in doubt during any portion of the final approach.

In all such cases the reason for the instruction or advice shall be given to the pilot.

### Transfer of Control

transfer of control from one controller to another will only take place when the accepting controller has confirmed to the transferring controller that the ac has been positively identified.

### Wakte Turbulence Radar Separation Minima

different wake turbulence separation minima in different States.    

ICAO requires in approach and departure phase    

* an ac is operting directly behind another ac at the same altitude or less than 1000ft below;
* both ac are using the same runway, or parallel runways separated by less than 760m; or
* an ac is crossing behind another ac, at the same altitude or less than 1000ft below.

          HEAVY   MEDIUM    LIGHT
SUPER      6NM     7NM        8NM
HEAVY      4NM      5NM       6NM
MEDIUM      --      --        5NM

Arriving aircraft

distance separation for wake turbulence purposes between ac approaching to land is shown in the table.

some EU status use the following wake turbulence separations based on time  LIGHT behind SUPER     4 mins
  MEDIUM behind SUPER   3 mins
  LIGHT behind MEDIUM or HEAVY  3 mins
  MEDIUM behind HEAVY   2mins
