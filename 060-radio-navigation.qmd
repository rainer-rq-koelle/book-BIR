## Radio Theory

production: oscilating electrical current & aerial   
electrons moving for- and backwards produce electromagnetic field    
field moves away with speed of light

aerial ~ transducer = transforming enery from one type to another: alternating current to free electromagnetic wave = 'radio frequency (RF) energy'

in receiving aerial -> current identical to the originating

transmitter -> tranmitter aerial ~~~ receiving aerial -> receiver -> amplifier -> headset

### Frequency and Wavelength

electromagnetic waves characterised by frequency or wavelength.   
speed of light constnat (in vacuum) 3 * 10^8 m/s

alternating current that cycles once in a second will produce one wave in that time -> wavelength

$$\lambda = \frac{c}{f}$$
doubling frequency -> half the wavelength

note for exam questions: speed of light 3 * 10^8 m/s ~ 300.000 km/s ~ 162.000NM/s

   c
  ---
  f $\lambda$

radio signal, freq 3 kHz -> what is the wavelength?     
3kHz = 3000Hz    
$\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3 * 10^8}{3 *10^3} = 10^5 m = 100.000m = 100km$

wavelength of 3.5cm -> what is the frequency?
$f = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{3*10^8}{3.5}*\frac{\frac{m}{s}}{cm}$ = 3*10^8 / 0.035 = 8.57GHz

Equipment Extremely High Freq   EHF   30-300GHz     1cm-1mm   milli-metric

### Phase and Phase Difference

phase angle := positions on a radio wave are expressed in degrees from 0 ... 360    
by definition, measurement of phase angle starts when aomplitude is increasing through zero

in phase = two transmissions with same wavelength/frequency start at same time ~ synchronised.    
out of phase = difference, delta expressed in degrees

note: signals can be in phase with different amplitude, however, wavelength or frequency identical

phase comparison, same wavelength   
avoid cancelling out of signals (i.e., if out of phase by 180deg)

modulation = additional of information to a carrier wave (or transporter)
= process of impressing and transporting infomation by radio waves

modulation can be achieved by i) changing amplitude, ii) changing frequency, or iii) phase of the signal

AM = Amplitude Modulation ~ simplest form of modulation = variation of amplitude of the carrier wave to transmit information

Sidebands   
modulation = imposing intelligence on carrier wave = "heterodyning"   
when 2 frequencies are heterodyned => 2 additional frequencies are created on top of the original carrier wave = sidebands

example: AM signal, carrier wave 400kHz, intelligence of 1 to 3 kHz   
lower side band: 400kHz - 1 kHz & 400kHz - 3kHz

SSB = single sideband transmission = removal of carrier wave and sideband ~ lower power requirement and reduced bandwidth, by convention only the lower sideband     
short range VHF communication systems  DO NOT remove carrier wave.    
long range HF communication systesm use SSB (with suppressed carrier wave)

### Frequency Modulation

instead of varying amplitude, change of wave frequency

FM receiver can clip signal to remove extraneous variations in amplitude.  
FM audio signal = high fidelity reproduction of the original without interference from static.

mixture of frequencies more complex than AM, (virtually) impossible to strip out sidebands   
thus: FM => higher bandwidth, require more power (than AM SSB signal)    
FM transimission requires about 3 times the power required for AM SSB   
and twice the bandwidth

to avoid frequency congestion, FM signals restricted to low power and thus SHORT ranges (becuase of higher bandwidth occupied)

advantage: less static noise/interference
disadvantage:   
  + greater power requirement
  + greater bandwidth, and
  + more complex transmitting and receiving equipment
  
### Phase Modulation

phase modulation allows for the sending of information in form of instantaneous variations in the phase of the carrier wave.   
== Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)

PSK is used in GPS systems, in wireless local area networks LAN, and for bluetooth communication.

### Sending Binary Information

simplest form: morse code

typically achieved by interrupting := keying carrier wave to send a series of dots and dashes.    
~ pulse modulation (morse code, radar)

increasing information needs, more complex binary signals and pulse modulation = Amplitude Shift Keying ASK

FM for digital signals the sidebands are smaller than when sending for instance audio signals, and therefore the disadvantes of FM are less prominten.    
Using FM for digital transmissions is called Frequency-Shift Keying FSK.

Simpest form of phase-shift keying is Binary Phase Shift keying BLSK. This transmits digital information by simply reversing the phase of the carrier wave.

example: binary signal of zeros and ones    
ASK uses an interruped carrier wave (e.g. for the ones)    
FSK varies the frequencies for ones and zeros     
BPSK reverses the phase at every change from one to zero or vice versa.

### Emission Classification

radio transmissions are classified by a three digit ITU code:    
  1. symbol := modulation
  2. symbol := type of modulating signal
  3. symbol := type of information carried
  
NDB    
  NON carrier without modulation
  A1A carrier with keyed morse code modulation
  A2A carrier with amplitude morse code
  
A3E carrier with amplitude modulated speech used for VHF communication

### Polarisation

radio waves are composed of 2 elements: i) electrical or E field, and ii) magnetic field at right angle to electrical field, called H field    
E and H-fields are thus orthogonal and in phase.

vertical polarised wave is a wave in which all the electrical oscillation (E-field) is in the vertical plane.    
Vertical aerial will produce vertical polarised wave requiring a vertical aerial to receive it.   
In analogy, horizontal one will produce horizontally polarised waves.

VHF communication frequencies are vertically polarised and the aircraft aerial are vertical.    
Navigation frequenices (e.g. VOR) are horizontally polarised and the aerials are horizontal, often in V shapre on the fin of the aeroplane.

### Aerials

diploes := simplest aerial vertical or horizontal conductor, the orientation depending on the polarisation, with a length of half the wavelength to be transimitted or received.    
dipole areial ~ $\frac{\lambda}{2}$

monopoles (or single pole) aerial size is effectively half a dipole and therefore has an ideal size of a quarter of the wavelength for optimum efficiency.

top view: ciruclar / omnidirectional ~ aerial transmits equally in all directions.  
side view: monopole aerial transmits well horizontally, but there is an aread overhed where there is no transmission (cone of silence) = no signal.

ideal dipole aerial is half or quarter of the wavelength   


VHF ~ metric band, vertically polarised, with wavelengths from 10m to 1m ==> monotpol receiving aerials placed on the top of the aircraft ~ signal path to/from antenna is not obstructed by parts of the aircraft (top antennas), Length about 2.5 and 25cm.   

VOR aerials are dipoles in the same frequency range, and signals are horizontally polarised.    
=> V shaped aerials on the fin of the aeroplane, each half being a quarter wavelength and therefore in total making up a half wave diploe.

Antenna Shadowing = positioning of aerials is important as the received signal strength is reduced is there is either another aerial or physical obstrauction in the line-of-sight path.   
Another aerial in the way takes energey from the radio wave as it received the signal leaving less for the aerial behind to detect.

### Parabolic Aerials

oldest generation of directional aerials/antenna ~ mathematical shape of parabol => capture of "pencil beam" (or "conical beam")   
not 100% efficient     
generate sidelobes and backscatter, the more efficient, the lower sidelobes and back scatter/energy loss.    
about 2/3 or energy can get lost in sidelobes.    
refrlections from sidelobes can cause interference and confusion to a directional signal.

groubd based radars often make use of kust a section of the aerial to track in only two dimensions.    
The beam is comparatively tight in the horizontal plane, but would not have much definition in the vertical pane.

parabolic antenna typically ground based primary radar systems and aircraft weather radar.

### Phase Array Aerials

modern alternative to parabolic dish = phase array aerial ~ series of conducting elements like small dipoles are arranged in a line and are fed signals in phase with each other.   
interference pattern they produce acts like a pencil beam.

sidelobes are still present, but the advantage of phase array aerials over parabolic aerials is that the energy loss in sidelobes is less to a 1/3 of the total.

examples:   
PSR (parabolic) and SSR (phase array)

slotted scanners or slotted planar arrays ~ (function like) phase array aerials   
vertical dipoles elements are replaced by a series of slots which act as resonante cavities to produce the radio signal.   

reduced energy loss ~ more energy concentration in tighter beam.

most modern aircraft use slotted planar arrays.

note: all dish aerials produce sidelobes. Phase array and slotted planar arrays produce smaller sidelobes.

## Wave Propagation

### Refraction

change in density will result in refraction ~ higher density slower   
amount of refraction ~ change in speed, its frequency, and angle at which it hits the new medium.

change in speed := refractive index (e.g. glass ref ind = 1.5, the higher the freq, the higher the refraction)   
in Ionosphere (refractive index < 1, higher refraction for lower frequencies!)

radio waves are refracted (speed change) due to surface (passing over) or because of the medium they are passing through

### Diffraction

wave passes through a hole ~ circular waveform past the hole    
hole acted as point source and retransmitted the wave

diffraction also happens when passing over sharp objects.

diffraction is greater at longer wavelengths ~ low frequencies

### Reflextions and Re-Radiation

specular reflection ~ simple reflection (mirror like)   
reflection dependent on density and smoothness of reflecting surface material and angle

smooth surface ~ mirror     
rough surface ~ reflection in all directions := diffuse reflection

note: surface reflection dependendent on wavelength/frequency

radar systems -- reflection is an integral part of design -- some return is specular, but most comes from small parts of the taerget airacraft structure acting as little receiving aerials which re-radiate the transmission.    
This effect happens also with water droplets in weather radars.   
Design caution to ensure radar wavelength compatible with target size, i.e. same size or smaller as target.

radar reflection is most likely when the wavelength is compatible with the target size!

### Attenuation

attenuation := loss of signal strength of a (electro-magnetic) wave.    
in vacuum ~ no attentuation   
in atmosphere -> electrions in dust and water droplets absorb some of the energy

atmosphereic attenuaation increases wtih increasing frequency, significant above 1 GHz    

surface attenuation := radio waves passing over Earth's surface loose energy and slow down    
surface atttnuation is greatest and speed is lowest over the ICE CAPS, then desert areas, then over other land, and there is least attenuation over SEA

surface attenuation increases as frequency increases (just at atmospheric attenuation); both affected by same substances, rock and water.

Waves passing through electrically charged atomes at the edges of space known as the ionosphere are also attenuated:   
HOWEVER: ionospheric attenuation increases as frequency decreases


### Space Wave

space wave := line-of-sight wave = standard propagation of all frequencies; range limited by obstructions and curvature of Earth surface.

VHF and EHF only propage with space wave => limited in range.    
Ground reflected waves are also included in this category.

maximum theoretical range of a space wave in UHF or VHF in NM 

$$max_theo_range = 1.23 \sqrt{H_1} + 1.23 * \sqrt{H_2}$$
H1 = height of transmitter, and H2 height of receiver, in FEET ft
range in nautical miles NM

example:   
aircraft at 8000ft communication to ground station. What is max theoretical range of the signal?   

H1(aircraft) 8000ft, ground station (assumed) 0ft/MSL    
max theoretical range = 1.23 (sqrt(0) + sqrt(8000)) = 1.23 * sqrt(80 * 100) ~ 1.23 * (9 *10) = 1.23 * 90 ~ 110NM

### Surface Waves

at lower frequencies, radio waves pass over hills and buildings and are diffracted. 
Effect increased by slower wave front near Earth's surface caused by ground conductivity (resulting in downward component of movement ~ pull to surface).    
=> surface wave follows curvature of Earth

diffraction greatest at low frequencies -> low frequencies tend to form surface waves    
travel distance dpendent on surface attenuation which is lowest at low frequencies and over sea.    
==> surface waves are longest for low(est) frequencies

surface waves    
  + HF band ~ 100NM
  + MF band ~ 500NM
  + LF band ~ 1000NM
  + VLF band ~ 4000NM
  
surface waves and space waves will occur at short range and the combination is called: "ground wave".

surface wave propagation not affected by time of day.

### Sky Waves

sky waves are radio waves refracted from Ionosphere.    
Ionosphere - ionised component of atmosphere ranging from 60-400km above the surface and divided in 3 layers, i.e. D, E, and F layer.

Depth and density of each layer varies with time of day, season and solar activity.

Ionosphere ~ gas molecules (normally with no electrical charge) are split into positive and negative ions.   
Density of ions increases with height and intensity of readiation (solar and cosmic radiation).   
Ionosphere is weaker at night than during day due to change of solar radiation.

Change of ion density -> refraction of radio waves (medium change).    
Most refraction occurs at 125km = E layer.    
Wave of low enough frequency at the correct angle of incidence will be refracted back to earth.     
Some refraction also at F layer.

VHF and higher are certainly refracted if they pass through the Ionosphere, but are not bent enough to come back to Earth.    
I.e., sky waves do not occur at all at VHF and higher frequencies.


### HF Skywaves

lower frequencies = higher refraction in Ionosphere, HF refracted back to Earth as skywave.

minimum skip distance := distance from transmitter to first returning (refracted) skywave; for HF typically 600-1200NM    
near transmitter, HF propagates as space wave and surface wave ~ 150NM

==> area between the end of the sufrace wave range and the first returning skywave (between 150NM and 1000NM) where no signal is received.   
"dead space" or "skip zone".

skip distances increae at night ~ weaker ionosphere ~ less ino density due to lower radiation/no solor radiation => less refraction.    

maximu skip distance occurs when the signal leaves the Earth at a tangent, refracts from the Ionosphere, and returns at a tangent to the Earth's surface.    
Maximum theoretical skip distance from the E layer is about 1500NM.

Note: longer distances due to "multi-hop transmissions" due to Earth refractions/retransmission.

### ML/LF Skywave Interference

ML/LF refract more from Ionosphere = reduced skip distance.
MF/LF have longer surface waves ==> no dead space/skip zone at all around 300-400NM.

==> receiver will pick up both: surface wave and (first returning) skywave which may interfere with each other.

interference: different travel distances ~ variation in phase possible == amplified signal or cancellation.

typically Ionosphere signals move continuously in and out of phase (= increases and decreases) ~ fading == indication that the signal has taking  two paths to the receiver.   

During daytime: signals passing through Ionosphere are subject to inospheric attentuation, greatest at low frequencies.   
==> MF and LF are more attenuated that HF ==> interference unlikely during daytime.   
==> higher fading during night-time (i.e., between dusk and dawn) ~ weaker Ionsophere and associated attentuation.

Skywaves are    
  + reliable in the HF band 
  + do not (normally) occur at VHF and higher
  + cause interference in MF/LF
  
Skywaves are used in HF voice communication and also in HF as part of the ACARS messaging system (long-range communication).

### Sporadic E

skywaves do not "normally" occur in VHF, but intimes of very high solar activity the E layer is much more heavily ionised that usual, called "sporadic E.    
Thus, it becomes dense enough to generate returning skywaves in the lower VHF band.

Unusual, but can lead to unexpected long-range reception in VHF.

### Atmospheric Ducting

Given "right conditions", VHF, UHF, SHF and EHF bands can get "trapped" within a layer in the atmosphere := atmospheric duct.

Atmospheric duct allows for long range propagation over the visual horizon (= atmosphereic ducting or super-refraction).

Near surface ducts ~ marked temperature inversions and a rapid decrease in humidity with height.    
Air mass subsidence (surface high pressure) systems can produce elevated ducts.   

Atmospheric ducting generally unpredictable.     
But, "always" some ducting that extends line-of-sight by about 15%. This is accounted for in the range formula for VHF and UHF.

atmospheric sub-refraction = where atmospheric refraction is less than normal -> causes reduced maximum theoretical range. 

### VLF Propagation

VLF wavelengths in order of tens of kilometers and low frequencies that normally no skywaves will form and completely attenuated by the Ionosphere.    
Surface waves are present up to 4000NM.

Ranges beyond 400NM are formed in VLF because the gap between Ionosphere and Earch acts as natural waveguide.    
This can happen when VLF wavelength is similar to gao height (lower levels of Ionosphere)

Ionospheric ducting := combines very long surface waves with guided waves to reach around the world.

### Static

static interfere with radio signals making communication difficult in HF band and interfering with the operation of navigation equipment.

statis is a natural phenomenon caused by electrical discharges in convective clouds.
Thunderstorms generate huge amounts of electricity and these discharges affect the lower frequencies, becoming insignificant in the VHF band.

MF/LF static can "swamp" signals from NAV beacons in those frequencies, i.e., NDBs => indicators in aircraft point to thunderstorm rather than the NAV beacon.

**precipitation static** when precipitation - particularly rain - strikes aircraft at a different electrical potential, there is a minute discharge of static.   
Again most troublesome in LF and MF bands.

rule of thumb: static and skywaves are unlikely above 30MHz.


### Doppler Effect

sound: change in pitch of engine noise as car passes observer    
water/beach: change in facing waves when moving in or out of water

change in received frequency = Doppler Shift    
Doppler shift proportional to the relative velocity    
indifferent to tranmitter or receiver moving (or both)

+ closing relative velocity produces increase in frequency, i.e., positive Doppler shift
+ if the transmitter and receiver are moving apart, the received frequency is lower, i.e., negative Doppler Shift.

Doppler shift is a small change to the tranmitted frequency, even for jet aircraft.   In most systems small enough to be within bandwidth.    
However, sysgem can be built to "look" for this shift.

Doppler Navigation systems use the Doppler shift in reflected signals to compute the groundspeed and drift of the aircraft.   
More sophisticated systems use this combined with heading from the compass system to compute the aircraft's track and ground speed  providing position readouts.

While mostly superseeded by satellite navigation and intertial navigation, Doppler navigation systems can still be found in some older helicopters.    
Doppler is also sometimes used for hover control.

Doppler is used   
+ some VOR beacon (called Doppler VOR)
+ identify moving targets in some forms of ground based radar called Moving Target Indicators (MTIs)
+ to identify areas of turbulence in some weather radars, and
+ (as one of two methods) to determine receiver's speed in satellite navigation.

### Propagation Summary

+ atmospheric and surface attenuation are greatest at high frequencies
+ ionospheric attenuation is greatest at low frequencies
+ ALL radio frequencies produce SPACE WAVES;    
  SKYWAVES only (reliably) present in HF band, create interference in MF/LF bands
+ SURFACE WAVES start to be significant in HF and get longer with LOW FREQUENCIES
+ atmospheric ducting is occasionally present in VHF and HIGHER    
  ionspheric ducting is present in VLF ONLY
+ static is greatest at LOWest FREQUENCIES

## NDB and ADF

NDB omni-directional beacon = simplest navigation beacon   
technological progress, NDBs subsequently (not) replaced by VOR/DME, GPS, and IRS

frequencies - WWII ~ requirement to provide information as fars as 600NM over sea, beacons on both sides of Atlantic ~ 1000-1500NM.   
propagation path/wave -> surface waves ==> MF and upper LF bands    
ICAO: 190-1750kHz    
in Europe, NDBs usually operate in the range 280-530kHz   
theoretical ranges over land ~ 300NM (for high power beacons due to higher surface attenuation)

### carrier waves and idents

unmodulated carrier wavem, ITU classification N0N.   
unmodulated signal = best direction finding result    

to make signal identifiable, NDBs use Morse code identifiers of 2-3 letters.    
Idents imposed on the carrier wave in one of 2 ways    
  + NON A1A beacons - older systems interrupe carrier wave to send a series of dots and dashes (keying); the uninterrupted carrier weave identification has the ITU classification A1A, whole transmission referred to as N0N A1A
  
problems:    
  + interrupted carrier wave at MF frequency is not naturally audible - require "extra" device to make it audible; and 
  + use may have erratic bearing indications when the carrier wave signal is being interrupted with Morse code (pauses)
  
### Beat Frequency Oscillators

to make unmodulated signal audioble, the ADF equipment in the aircraft incorporates a Beat Frequency Oscillator (BFO).   
produces freqency slightly removed from the received frequency and the two are then mixed together or herodyned.

mixing of the 2 frequencies produces an audible beat frequency, which is the difference of the 2. Example: oscillator generates signal of 401kHz to match a received signal of 400kHz = heterodyning the two produces additional frequencies at 401kHz + 400kHz = 801kHz and 401 - 400 = 1 kHz.   
Frequency at 1 kHz is the beat frequency and this is an audible tone.

BFO makes the inaudible audible = N0N carrier wave can be heard as a continuous tone which is then interrupted into morse for the A1A ident, then back to continuous tone of the N0N signal again.

A1A idents are nowadays extremely rare. BFO function is still available on modern aircraft with the switches labelled BFO or Tone.

### N0N A2A Beacons

more modern systems do not interrupt the carrier waves, but instead use an amplitude modulated Morse code signal for the identification: ITU A2A.

A2A signal does not need special equipment like the BFO to make it audible.   
A standard ADF receiver will strip the modulated signla off and present it to the aircrew as an audible Morse ident.

NDBs like this are referred to as N0N A2A beacons, N0N for the main carrier wave used for direction finding, and A2A for the intermittent ident.

Amplitude modulation of the morse identifier does still degrade bearing accuracy when the ident is playing - an unmodulated tone is always the best signal for direction finding - but not as much as with the A1A ident.

typically, Holding and airfield approach NSBs: N0N A2A; long range N0N A1A.

### Marine and Other beacons

NDBs are also used by shipping.   
Marine NDBs should not be used for IFR aircraft navigation (and not plotted on aviation charts).

Issue: frequencies for NDBs not exclusively allocated. E.g. long wave commercial radio band between 150ksz and 280kHz which overlaps the NDB band.

ADF receiver can happily pick up the readio stations above 190kHz and you can listen to the (amplitude modulated) broadcast.     
Note: the direction of the source of transmission for these commercial radio stations may ot be used for IFR navigation.

### Receiver Operation

Automatic Direction Finder ADF, replaced an earlier manual system called Radio Direction Finding (RDF, DF).    
Doth systems use rotating loop aerials.    

Technological progress: aerials smaller and faired. modern loop aerial looks nothing like the original. Concept staid the same.

### Loop Aerial

NDB signal vertical polarised -> singal passing over the loop induces an electric current in the vertical parts of the aerial.   
rotation of the loop in line with incoming signal then different phases will be received in each of the vertical bars and current will flow.   
When the aerial is at right angles to the direction of travel, both sides reeive the same phase signal and no current flows.    
If aerial rotated until no current flows, we can be sure it lies at right angles to the wave movement.     
Remaining question: in front of us or behind us.

Loop aerial polar diagram = plan view/aerial from above ~ value of induced current around it as the aerial is rotated we find a figure of eight shape with two clearly fined null points and two less clearly defined maxima.   
The double null is the ambiguity w just identified.

Cardiod - to resolve ambiguity, another vertical aerial is added to the system, the sense aerial.   
The sense aerial receives signals from all directions just like a monopole.   
It is carefully tuned to have a polar diagram diameter that just matches the loop aerial figure of eight polor diagramme.  

When the 2 polor diagrams are combined, the reception charateristics of the 2 aerials can be added and subtraced as appropriate to produce a hear shaped polar diagram : "cardioid". The cardioid has only one null point.

Rotating the loop to find the bearing = rotating the loop areial will rotate the null so that now when no signal is received by the combined aerial, the null is pointing directly at the beacon and the aerial combinaiton will be in line with the incoming signals.

Aerial position is relayed to flight deck instruments.   
These - in its simplest form - shows the relative bearing to the beacon.

### INstrument Displays

* simplest and oldest instruments are fixed card ADFs - sometimes called relative bearing indicators RBIs or radio compasses.

with a fixed card ADF, the bearing of the beacon from the aircraft is determined by adding the aircraft's heading to the relative bearing: magnetic bearing QDM = MH + RB; true bearing QUJ = TH + RB.    
Bearing from beacon/station is obtained by adding/subtracting 180 degrees.

* moving card ADFs - 2nd generation instruments provide a moving compass card so that the aircraft heading, usually magnetic, can be manually set at the top of the instrument.   
POint of needle indicates QDM, tail QDR.

* RMI = 3rd generation of instruments shows magnetic heading of the aircraft continuously at the top of the instrument using feeds from a remote indicating compass. The point of the needle now automatically indicates QDM and tail QDR.   
Radio Magnetic Indicator RMI is standard equipment on most commercial aircraft, either as a standalone insturment or displaying on the EFIS Navigation Display.

RMIs dispaly both ADF and VOR information. On most instruments the two RMI needles can be switched to show either two ADFs, 2 VORs or ADF and VOR.

QDM (head) or QDR (tail) shown are obtained using the aircraft's magnetic heading.   
If true bearings are required, the variation at the aircraft must be used rather than that at the NDB.

Becuase airccraft heading is effectively added to the relative bearing by the instrument to give a QDM, any errors in the aircraft compass system will make both the heading and the QDM and QDR readout at the two ends of the needle unreliable.   
But it will not affect the accuracy of the relative bearing.


### Errors and Accuracy

ADF subject to a number of errors.    
ICAO requirment is an accuracy of -/+5 degrees.   
ICAO Annex 10 requires a monitoring system fo rht beacons to check pwer output and that the ident is present.

* static - all forms of static can affect ADF. In snow and freezing rain, precipitation static reduces the accuracy and attenuation reduces the range of bearing information.
* thunderstorms - TS in the vicinity act as radio beacons and can cause the needle to deviate in their direction. VHF and VORs should be used in preference to ADF. TS can cause largest errors in ADF systems. At the very least, ADF needle will flail around, extreme cases, it will point directly at a very active thunderstorm. (UNPREDICTABLE)
* night effect - although prinicpal propagation of NDBs is ground/surface wave, it is possible for weak sky waves to be returned at night when the inosphere is less dense and inonospheric attenuation correrspondingly less. Change in polarisation (no longer vertical), coming from space at any anglea nd strike the top of the loop aerial where none would be present. --? null is no longer sharply defined and ADF needle hunts reducing the bearing accuracy. 

Night effect can be confirmed by turning the BFO on and listening for the carrier wave increasing and dereasing involume (Fading). Night effect is most likely AT DAWN OR DUSK, no likely at short range (below 200NM) because it is too close to the beacon for sky waves to return.

night effect is sky wave interference from the selected beacon
symptoms of night effect are a hunding needle and fading on the carrier wave   
night effect is greatest at dawn or dusk

* station interference - long ground waves of LF and MF signals mean that signals from other stations on similar frequencies overlap.   
If this occurs, ADF indications may be erratic because there is no sinle null.   
Listening for 2 separate idents. Can be avoided during daytime at least, by only using an NDB within its published rated range.   
At night, returning sky waves can cause rogue signals at considerable range.

rated ranges = published rated ranges quarantee sufficient signal strentgh and freedom from station interference. But without conssidering the effects of skywave interference by day only.

Rated range my be referred to as protected range.

* coastal refreaction - speed of surface wave is affected by surface (faster over water, slower over land) = speed change = wave refraction at low altitude as it passes over coastline. --> refraction always towards the coast (slower side over land pulls wave towards the cost)

the position readout suggest aircraft nearer to the coast than it acutally is (false bearing readout)    
effect increased the wider land-inward the beacon is sited => could be minimised by choosing beacons closer to the coast or flying at higher altitudes.  
can be avoided by taking bearings at right angle from coast when no refraction occurs.

* dip - some Bendix-King aerials suffer from an error called dip. This occurs when the receiver sense aerial is masked by the loop aerial.    
dip results in large bearing errors, only offures in a turn, and is greatest when the NDB is on a relative bearing of 45 or 135 left and right of the nose.

* mountain effect - at low altitudes multi-path signals reflected from or diffracted around terrain can cause erroneous readings. Effect diminishes with height as hills are further from the line of sight and interfere less with the surface wave.

### range 

range of a beacon controlled by its power.    
long range NDB have power output of about 10kW and a range over sea in excess of 500NM   
short range NDB ~ 150NM over land requires an output of 1 kW.

coarse formula:

$$maxrange = 3 * \sqrt{power in Watts}$$
Formula does not include effect of ground conductivity or frequency, only approximate max range.

Doubling the range requires 4 times the output power (due to square root).

NDB bearings have longer ranges over see than over land, because of better surface wave propagation.

range ofa  beacon is not always the same as its rated range!    
ICAO Annex 10 requires the power output of an NDB to generally match its agreed rated range, but an exception is made which allows the power to be greater, if no harmful interference to other facilities will result.    
Thus, rated ranges usually not greater than 200NM, while the effective range of NDBs can be up to 600NM over the sea.

### Types of NDB Stations

ADF equipment will work on any continuous transmission in the frequency range, including commercial radio stations in the MF band.

* **locators** = LF/MF NDB used as an aid to final approach usually with a range of 10 to 25NM (ICAO Annex 10) = low power NDBs at 15 to 40 Watts.    
locators are typically co-located with the ILS outer marker.
* **homing** and **holding NDBs** = beacons intended as an aid to transition from en-route portion to the detination airfield, rated coverage slightly less than 50NM, power output up to 200Watts.
* **en-route** and **long-range NDBs** = raged coverage in excess of 50NM, tend to be in LF end of the allocated frequencies to benefit from longer surface waves.

### Operating the equipment

ADF equipment is normally digitally tuned. -> panel typically for duplicated controls for 2 separate ADF systems (i.e., number 1 and number 2 ADF)

Tuning via selector knobs under frequency display    
turned on by selecting the ANT position (this uses the sense areal position only optimising audio reception for identification but not producing any bearing)

If BFO is required, toggle switches labelled BFO can be seleted to the appropriate system or, on an A2A beacon, select it off by leaving it in the NORM postion.

Once tunig and identification is complete, select ADF on the rotary switch to include the loop aerial and send bearing information to the RMIs.

TEST function to test system. Often ADFs without test facility = no way to check if the instrument has failed. Lack of failure warning indication is often cited as a limitation of older systems.

Select ANT for good audio - but no bearing.
Set    ADF for bearing information.

### Other ADF tuning panels

e.g. A320 - simple(r) to operate.

NAV button to take away control from FMS, then select DF and tune as required.    
Select BFO if required.  Newer systems apply BFO automatically.


### NDB Tracking

ADF needle points towards the beacon = ideal for tracking inbound or outbound from the NDB.   
in still air: point aircraft wher ethe MI indicates    
if wind; allow for wind correction/drift

when aircraft reaches beacon overhead ~ aircraft enters area of weak or no signal called "cone of confusion".   
ADF pointer will rotate around the dial until the signal is (propoerly) restored.

tracking outbound - needle reversed and points to the station, tail of needle shows the QDR = radial the aircraft is on ~ correct for wind drift.

wind changes - with changing wind, tracking and drift correction will be incorrect and the bearing of the NDB will change.    
e.g. wind to zero = drift correction to "strong", QDM wanders as aircraft steers away from bearing/track.

with the heading out by more than the drift, the effect is to push the head of the needle away from the heading bug.

PUSH THE HEAD AND PULL THE TAIL.

example: track 070 away from beacon - heading 060 - no wind    
heading bug "pulls" the tail of the needle towards it (to show the right radial 060).

==> PUSH THE HEAD or PULL THE TAIL

example: RMI showing ADF/yellow 150. Intecept bearing of 130 inbound to NDB in still air; heading bug 095

"push" beyond = answer 170

inbound ISI: soll = 130, is = 150 => from soll to ist + x ~ 170


No allowance for wind/drift and aircrew only follows point of the needle == curved path == curve of pursuit   
homing without allowing for drift is not used in practical navigation because it is inefficient and inelegant. == always correct for drift


### Intercepting a Desired Track

NDB -/+5 deg ~ established on track


## VOR - VHF omni-directional range

VORs more sophisticated than NDBs and operate at shorter range.  
line-of-sight frequencies in VHF band = free from most errors that affect NDBs.

108-117.975 MHz;   
band shared with ILS: 108-112MHz - VOR frequencies allocated at even 100kHz pacing.
112-117.950MHz = only VOR = spacing 50kHz

==> 108.2 and 113.35MHz = VOR frequency; 108.1Mhz ILS (!= VOR)

VOR and Doppler VOR DVOR.

standard VOR (30 revolutions a second) produces a limacon shaped polor diagrame whcih rotates with the dipole at 30 revolutions a second.    
Limacon has no sharp NULL (like cardioid of ADF)

receiver "listening" to signal, amplitude appears to go up and down 30 times a second as limacon rotates (typically clockwise) = received signal is amplitude modulated at 30Hz.    
phase differs of the AM signal depending on the bearing of the aircraft from the VOR. = variable phase signal.    
phase difference is compared to reference phase - omnidirectional reference signal also at 30Hz. Ref signal is frequency modulated FM to be distinguishable.

both signals synced to show phase differnce of 0 for magnetic North 000/360.

receiving aircraft looks at phase differnce between FM reference signal and AM variphase signal and displays it as a radial QDR.

If true bearings are desired, the variation at the staion must be used in the conversion. This is because radials are referenced to magnetic north at the station rather than the aircraft.

DOPPLER VOR = ring of starionary omnidirectional dipoles 13.5m in diameter. VHF signal is switched continously around the ring of aerials so that it appears to come towards the aircraft and then move away. The relative movement of the origin of the signal produces a Doppler shift/shift in frequency that varies with bearing.    
== variphase signal is FM!   
==> reference signal is AM.   this would produce reverse sensing in aircraft receiver ~~ DVOR signal rotates anti-clockwise!!! (reverse the reverse)

aircraft tracking a constant phase difference either inbound QDM or outbound QDR will follow a great circle path

### Cone of confusion

area overhead VOR transmitter where it is not possible to obtain accurate bearing information.

ICAO: confe of confusion 50dep from vertical.

radius of cone can be calculated as 1.2 * height ==> maximum possible diameter of 12 NM at 30.000ft (in reality less)

### Identification

VORs - 3 letter Morse ident modulated at 1020Hz repeating every 10 seconds.    
some beacons have voice identiiers as well.  (this is Stuttgart omni range ... morse code)

if VOR & DME, the DME ident will be heard as a higher pitch 1350Hz every 40 seconds.

### VOR Types

VORs primarily used for en-route IFR navigation.
Many European VORs about 80NM apart to ensure aircraft to stay within confines of airway 10NM wide (1 in 60 rule).

* **terminal VOR** low power beacon used as part of an airfield approach. TVORs often share the lower frequencies with ILS.
* **broadcast VOR** = usually a terminal NAVAID with voice broadcast giving out the airfield weather, the aerodrome terminal information service or ATIS, super imposed on the carrier wave
* **test VOR** (VOT) = low power beacon sited at airfiled (usually in the US) which puts out a constant phase difference of zero in alll directions. ~ allows to test aircraft equipment accuracy on the ground.
VOR test funtion with course set to 000, course deviation indicator should center with FROM indicated, RMI to indicate 180 QDM. Beacon identifier for VOT is a series of dots.

### Airborne Equipment

antenna, receiver, and instrument display    
antenna is horizontal as would suit a horizontally polarised signal, and approximately a quarter of a wavelength long.   
VOR aerials are often seen high on the tails of light aircraft

VOR and ILS usually use the same control panel.    
The aid in use is determined by the frequency selected.

VOR information canbe displayed on an omni-bearing indicator OBI which is used if the aircraft has no electronic compass information, or and RMI and a Horizontal Sitaution Indicator HSI

### Omni Beaing Indicators

omni-bearing selector knob = required bearing    
==> course deviation indicator (hinged at top) showing degrees of displacement from the selected bearing AND    
TO/FROM window/flag indicating wether the selected bearing is a QDR or a QDM.

full deflection = 10 degress

alternative instrument/display - vertical scale/grid for the ILS glideslope, not hinged at one end; here G/S flag (red) as not glideslope signal (as tuned to a VOR)

CHECK FOR SOME SCREEN SHOTS/INSTRUMENT figures

example: 060 selected, TO flag, deviation indicator shows 2 dots left     
==> QDM 060, dot ~ 2deg ==> 2 dots = 4 degs "right" of QDM    
==> bearing to station = 060 - 4 = 056 deg, and on 056 + 180 = 236 radial QDR "inbound" 

Note: display is independent from heading, however it makes sense to fly either TO or FROM a station.

example:   
aircraft heading 075 (M). CDI course 0f 025. VOR indicates TO, needle right deflection.    
In which quadrant to the station defined by what radials?

TO = 025 == QDR 025+180 = 205    
RIGHT == left of course = 025 - 090 = 385 - 090 = 295 (or 205 + 90)

"FLY INTO THE NEEDLE" 

Note: for exam questions: no heading input to OBI - heading is irrelevant regarding location to/from beacon or quadrant.     
selection of intercept radial determines a (next) heading!

example: heading 210, magnetic variation at VOR is 5W and at aircraft 10W.    
CDI shows: TO, deflection right 2 dot, CRS 200   
What radial?

CRS/OBI = 200 ==> target QDR = 020   
course to the right ==> left, 1 dot = 2 deg ~ actual QDR 020 + dot    (2 dot disply => 1 dot = 5deg) ==< actual QDR = 020 + 5 = 025

variation only relevant when TRUE radial desired, station synced signal = station variation, here not asked. 

### Radio Magnetic Indicators RMI

VOR information is usually displaed on RMI.   
This requires an electronic compass feed, and so OBIs are still used in light aircraft.   

RMI feeds compass heading to the top of the dial and the tail of the VOR needle is driven to the detected phase difference on the dial.   
point of the needle indicates the QDM and the tial the QDR.

needles can be associated to NDBs, in this case DME readout would show off flag.

### Horizontal Situation Indicator HSI

HSI usually used togethr with RMI.   
HSI has electronic compass to feed top of dial (showing compass heading)

HSI have rotating center section independent of the compass card.   
Manual selection of particular course/bearing shows deviation from bearing/course similar to OBI; full scale deflection 10 or more degrees; on a 2 dot HSI each dot represents 5 degs; 5 dots ~ 2 degs   
TO/FROM indicator

example: HSI, compass heading 300, course selected 280, TO, deflextion 2 dots RIGHT

==> (tail) target QDR 100, 4 to 5 degrees to our right ==> current QDR = 100 +5 = 105

### Use of HSIs and RMIs

RMI information is stometimes overlaid on the ompass card element of the HSI to combine both instruments; i.e., EFIS versions of HSI.

Example HSI next to RMI, both tuned to same station    
- ac heading 030 - shown on both    
- RMI shows bearing TO station of 060 (QDR = 240)    
- HSI course selected 090, TO flag; deviation at full sale tothe LEFT ~ 090 bearing is more than 10 degrees away

### VOR tracking

VOR tracking can be accomplished using either RMI, OBI, or HSI.

RMI ~ equivalent to NBD - follow bearing (and/or correct for wind)    
OBT indicates in the correct sense (i.e., left/right indications) if the heading is roughly the same as the bearing selected. To track to a beacon turn the course selector knob (OBS) around until TO is indicatoed and the cdi is central.    
== selected bearing - still air heading to beacon. Adjust for drift and follow CDI as commands.

Heading instructions are deliberately vague, using words like turn left a little, because the readial sensitivity of the instrument increases the closer the beacon.   
--> smaller corrections, if closer to beacon.

tracking FROM a beacon:   
- OBS until FROM and CDI centered    
- turn aircraft to a heading that matches the selected bearing   
- correct for drift
- follow command

intercepting a bearing on either the OBI or HSI: start by setting up the required bearing wiht the OBS of course selector.

### Procedure Turns

VORs and NDBs can be used to execute procedure turns.   
These are formal turning paths used to reverse the direction as part of a procedural approach.

Most common: 45/180 procedure

- start at facility or fix with track guidance - either timed or limited by radial or DME distance    
- 45 degrees turn to the LEFT    
- timed straight outbout leg without track guidance; CAT A and B: 1 min, CAT C,D, and E: 1:15min = 75 secs    
- 180 turn to the right to intercept inbound track

### Errors and Accuracy

VOR is free from sky wave interference and coastal refraction because of its higher frequency and line-of-sight transmission.   
Bending of signal by structure of aeroplance does not accect the indicated bearing, i.e. no quandrantal error.

Designated operational coverage DOC of a VOR, the range, sector, and altitude where freedome fom interfreence is guqanranteed, is given in the AIP.   
Unlike protected range of NDBs, this is valid both by day and night.   
Outside DOC interfreence from other stations is possible.   
DOC is sometimes referred to as "service volume".    

ICAO estimate the overall fixing accuracy of VORs to be -/+5 degrees on 95% of occasions.

When flying VOR approaches, ICAO Doc 8168 required the aircraft to be within half a scale deflection, i.e., 5 degrees of the selected bearing, to be considered "on track".

### Scalloping and Site Error

reflections from terrain and mane made obstructions can cause errors as 2 signals with different phase differences interfere, "site error".

Site errors cause VOR indicator to move rapidly from side to side. On a RMI it will make the indicator needle wobble.   
This effect is known as "scalloping".   

Scalloping different from beam bends wihch are also caused by reflections from buildings, but which are more predciable slight curves within the system tolerances.   
Where Scalloping is known to occur, it is notified in the COM sectino of the AIP and on approach plates.

Conventional VOR variphase signals are continuously transmitted through 360 and differing amplitude.    
" continuous"  reflection by obstructions near transmitter.   
DVOR variphase signal is switched around much larger aerial, and is likely to reflect from an obstruction and hit the aircraft receiver only for a small part of its cycle.   
Thus, DVOR suffer less from multipath signals; and the reason given is because of the larger aerial.

### Multipath Signals and Mountain Effect

Reflections from terrain at a distance from the transmitter may be referred as 'multipath signals', the error arising may unusually be referred to as mountain effect, although that name is normally reserved for the equivalent NDB error.

### Atmospheric Ducting

atmospheric ducting can lead to synchronous transmissions even within the DOC.   
Ducting is inherently unpredictable, so no allowance can be made for it, illustrating the need to check the station ident whenever a beacon is used.

Scalloping causes rapid deflections that can not be followed by an aircraft.

### Power and Range

output power of tranmitter impacts range: 200Watts -> up to 200NM, 50 Watts only good for short range transmissions.

max theoretical range: = 1.23 sqrt(H_t) + 1.23 * sqrt(H_rx)

### Equipment Errors

ICAO Annex 10 requires VOR transmitters to be monitored to make sure they put out bearings to at least an accuracy of -/+ 1degree.   
Should the monitor detect a greater bearing error, transmitter to be shut down and stanby transmitter to be brought online.   
Station to be shut down, if signal strenth drops by more than 15% or if monitor fails.

During the transfer period the sation ident either ceases or is replaced by a continuous tone.   
The ident is resumed when the standby tranmitter is operating within limits.ß


## Instrument Landing System ILS

precision approach system, technological progress/accuracy -> categories.   
normal: CAT I, most capable CAT III.

### Principle

separate ground transmitters provide beams to show lateral position of aircraft in reference to extended center line, i.e., the localiser, and  the vertical displacement from glidepath.   
possible short range beacons to mark distance from touchdown, now supplemented or replaced by distance measuring equipment DMEs.

localiser works in VHF band: 108 - 119.95 MHz (shared with VORs; localiser uses odd 100kHz frequencies and odd + 5okHz, e.g. 108.1MHz, 108.15MHz, 108.3MHz, 108.35MHz) => VOR 108.2/108.4MHz; 108.25 is not allocated!

glidepath uses 40 spot UHF frequencies from 329.3Mhz to 335Mhz paired with the VHF frequencies.  
glidepath frequency is automatically selected when the paired VHF channel is selected.

marker beacons operate on 75MHz

### Identification

The ILS ident is a 1020Hz tone amplitude modulated on the localiser carrier wave..
The ident is a 2 or more letter morse code transmitted at 6 words a minute.   
If ambiguous: ident preceded by letter I to signal ILS ident, e.g. Mardid Torrejon: IJTA with nearby NDB TJA.    
On some CAT I or II systems voice can be superimposed onto the localiser carrier wave.

### Instrument Displays

Omni-Bearing Indicator (as for VOR) or a Horizontal Situation Indicator HSI.   
In some cases, ILS information repeated on the Attitude Indicator or EFIS Primary Flight Display PFD.

Displacement presented as "command needles" from central point.
Displaced right = fly right, displaced above = fly up = decrease rate of descent.
red warning flags = unreliable localiser or glideslope signals.

ILS Localiser display is less sensitive than glidepath.   
Full scale localiser deflection := 2.5 degrees  => 1 dot = 0.5 deg  
full scale glidepath deflection := 0.7 degrees => 1 dot = 0.15 deg

displays with circle = first dot!

### HSI

if VOR indicator is used, it is important to realise that the bearing or course selection will still function. BUT, it will not have an effect on the information displayed.   
The ILS centre line bearing of QDM is usually selected at the top of the instrument for neatness.

some HSI: glidepath information on the right side, localiser on main instrument

With VOR information the deviation information and TO/FROM indicator on the HSI were sensitive to heading, VOR information never indicates reverse sense.   
CAUTION: ILS information not impacted by selected track/course, i.e., ILS does not send out radial type signals (like VOR).

==> select ILS QDM.

### Localiser Operation

2 overlapping beams:
  + one amplitude modulated at 90Hz ~ left side of centerline; and
  + one amplitude modulated at 150Hz~ right side of centerline.

receiver (aircraft) derives center line displacement from signal strengths, i.e.,
if more 90Hz than 150Hz = LEFT side of centerline => needle deflection to RIGHT = FLY RIGHT

when depth of modulation is equal = DDM = 0 => ON CENTER LINE

by convention: 90Hz (left side of centerline) = YELLOW lobe
150Hz (right side of centerline) = BLUE lobe.


### Localiser Aerial and Coverage

localiser transmitter usually in line with runway centerline, about 300m off the upwind end.   
Frangible aerial may be 20 meters wide and 3 meters high.   
Consists of a number of dipole and reflector elements.

localiser signals protected out to 25NM to a height of just over 6000ft.   
Beyond that range they mau be received, but not relied upon.

within 17NM - 35deg left and right of centerline
17-25NM     - 10 degs

if terrain: reduced to 18NM within 10deg coverage and 10NM elsewhere.   
dimensions will be varied for steeper glidepaths and different categories.

in unusal cases LOC signals can be reflected outside the coverage area and may cause reverse indiator or false signals.   
Reflections from terrain or buildings possible ~ bent localiser. Carefully checked to be withikn limits during calibration and notified on approach plate.

LOC can only be used for navigation inside protected area.

OFFSET LOCaliser - if it cannot be sited on extended runway centerline upwind, i.e., placed next to runway. (YELLOW and BLUE) Beams are then adjusted to pass through centerline at decision height.

If offset is more than 5deg = ILS no longer "precision approach" and approaches must be flown to MDA/MDH limits!

### Glidepath

glidepath works in analogy to localiser with signals in UHF band modulated at 90 and 150Hz.

90Hz = ABOVE glidepath ==> FLY DOWN
150Hz = BELOW glidepath ==> FLY UP.

nominal glidepath (Annex 10): 3deg; in some cases up to 6deg.   
E.g. London City 6 degree glideslop.

glideslope aerial positioned next to the instrument touchdown point (about) 300m/1000ft in from threshold and approximately 120 m off the runway centerline.

### Glidepath Coverage

min coverage angle 0.45 * glidepath angle    
upper limit        1.75 * glidepath angle

from above: coverage extends to 10NM, up to 8 degrees left and right of center line.

example - limits of 3deg glidepath    
- lower limit: 0.45 * 3 = 1.35 deg
- upper limit: 1.75 * 3 = 5.25 deg
- left and right: 8 degrees from centerline

glidepath > 3.5. "steep" glidepath.
steep glidepath limits 8 degrees left and right BUT only 8 NM out!

### False glideslops

transmission -> sidelobes, sidelobe beams less powerful than main lobe; however, can trigger falst glideslop indiation.

==> given elevation angle: no false glideslop below coverage ==> intercept glideslop from below = first intercept = main glideslope == NEVER from above!

first false glideslope about twice the angle and triggering a descent rate of > 1500ft/minute!

==> standard ILS GS intercept := level flight at 1500-2500ft above aerodrome level
once LOC established, continue level until intercept from below   
then pitch adjusted for rate of descent

### Marker Beacons

ICAO Doc 8168 requires a fix or facility to allow aircrew to crosscheck height against range.
ILS: up to 3 marker beacons.

outer marker: (about) 4NM from threshold (blue)
middle marker: (about) 0.6 NM from threshold (orange/amber)
inner marker: at threshold (white)

75MHz (VHF) fan shaped beam pointing upwards.   
signals modulated to provide audible morse tone

outer - blue   - low pitch(400Hz) - letter O: ---   (2 dashes a second)
middle - amber - medium pitch (1300Hz) - letter C (aka Center): -.- (2 dashes a second, 6 dot per second)
inner - white - high pitch (3000Hz) - letter I: .. (6 dots a second)

markers becoming less common/increasingly replaced with DME.  
Such DMEs also paired with ILS LOCaliser frequency (i.e., automatically selected).
DME reliable withiin lateral limits of localiser up to 25.000ft

airway markers are extremely seldom (why do i speak in ILS section about this?)
signal moutains and use same light and tone coding.
morse ident at siz to ten words a minute.

### ILS tracking

localiser captured before glidepath, typically at altitudes of 1500-2500ft above aerodrome.

"established on localiser" = half a scale deflection of the required track.   
aircrew must not start descent unless established on localiser.

"established on glidepath" = maintain half scale up/down deflection.

if aircraft deviates outside half scale on localiser or more than half scale below glidepath ==> immediate missed approach procedure (no longer obstacle free/guaranteed).

### Back course approach

mirror signal on "reverse" side of localiser.

in Europe: back course approaches not approved.
in US/CAN: relatively common, but only non-precision approach (MDH/MDA) or departure procedure.

when used (as backup reference) post departure to track runway direction, back-course signal operate in the correct sense.

!! glideslope signal to be ignored == only for non-precision approaches!

### ILS Categories

nuances between ICAO and EASA!

CAT ground accuracy aircraft minima
I   60m (200ft) above touchdown   200ft on baro altimeter, min RVR 550m
II  15m (50ft) above threshold    100ft on radio altimeter, min RVR 300m
IIIA  touchdown and beyond        0ft on radio altimeter, min RVR 200m
IIIB  touchdown and beyond        0ft on radio altimeter, min RVR 75m   (ICAO 50m)
IIIC  touchdown and beyond        0ft on radio altimeter, min RVR 0m

### ILS Critical and Sensitive Areas

ILS installation has areas plotted around both, the glideslope and localiser tranmitter aerials, where vehicles and aircraft movement will disturb the navigation signals.   
== ILS ccritical areas. All vehicles and aircraft are excluded from critical areas, if ILS in use.

Larger sensitive area where vehicle and aircraft MAY interfere with the signals but are only excluded during low visibility procedures LVP.   
At other times, movement in the sensitive areas is controlled.

### Holding Points

width of sensitive area will vary by ILS caegory, hence CAT II or CAT III holding points at larger airfields are further back from runway than the CAT I holding point.

Disturbance of critical area may cause scalloping, indicator changes from side to side which cannot be followed by aircrew/aircraft.

### System Monitoring

ILS signals can be disturbed by
+ transmitter faults
+ antenna damage
+ interfering signals, possibly from VHF FM radio stations
+ environmental disturbances
+ multi-path effects.

increasing problem: FM radio stations working on frequencies close to LOCaliser band (around 108 MHz).
ILS - AM is fitted with FM immune filters. ditto for VOR.

today: nearly all VHF navigation receivers FM immune for IFR. on smaller aircraft (sportsclub): VFR only placarded on VHF receiver (= not FM immune)

ICAO Annex 10 requires ground installation to ensure/monitor transmitter integirity
alerts ATC and operations staff about changes in the mean course line or reductions in signal strength, exceedance of predetermined limits.   
Ident will be removed and nav signal stopped within 6 seconds for a CAT I system and 2 seconds for a CAT II or III system.   
Localiser and glideslop are independently monitored.

CAT I system cuts 6 seconds after failure.

### Receiver

ILS receiver has automatic monitoring function.    
Shows warning flag for localiser and/or glideslope.

springs holding flags back - low (or no signal) in either 90 or 150Hz modulations == activation = reduced current = spring activates.


## Radar Theory


### primary and secondary radar

primary radar := reflection.    
secondary radar := signal "query" (interrogation), response by "transponder"

primary signal (strenth) going back and forth   
secondary only 1 way

primary radar displays target bearing and range.   
tranponder can reply with an active data stream, including aircraft identification, altitude, position, etc.


### Frequencies

progapagion characteristics -> signal design    
+ minimise static
+ minimal atmosphereic attenuation
+ line of sight propagaion

=> UHF/VHF band, higher frequencies could be used, but increasing atmosphereic attenuation would mean more power is needed for the same range.

radar characteristics: rather than transmitting in all directions, radar energy "bundled" (in a beam).   
Short wavelength produce the narrower beams that are needed to identify small targetst.

==> fourth requirement: short wavelength for narrow beams.

to a decent return, the wavelength used should be similar in size or smaller than the target. Radar used to detect rain in thunderstomrs should therefrore have a wavelength of centimeters or less.    
Similar wavelenths will also detect aircraft and mountains. 

==> 5. requ: wavelength chosen for target size.

4.+5. requirement important. Common to use higher frequencies in SHF band to get a narrow beam width at the correct wavelength and to accept that rande is reduced because of attenuation from atmosphere.    
Civil radars operate in the UHF and SHF bands.    
Military radars can use frequencies as high as EHF.

### Continous Wave Radar and Pulse Radar

two principal types of radar operations.

pulse radar sends out short bursts of energy and then determines the range of the target from the time it takes the pulse to return.   
advantage: single aerial can be used acting as transmitter when pulse is sent and then witching over to acet as receiver while it waits for the pulse to return.

simple - but limitation in maximum and minimum range.

continuous wave systems avoid some of the limitations of pulse radar max and min range, but, as there are no discrete pulses and echose as such, a different system must be used to determine range.   
CW -> radio altimeter.

### Pulse Radar Theory

transmitted pulses are sent at regular intervals.   
trnsmit - receive - transmit - receive ...

pulse recurrence period RPF (or pulse recurrence interval PRI)    
e.g. if it takes 0.5 seconds to complete one cycle of transmit and receive: pRP = 0.5 sec.    
==> 2 pulse per second = pulse repetition frequency PRF.   
a shorter PRP ~ more pulses in a second (higher PRF).
reduced period = higher frequency.

PRP = 1 / PRF

example: PRP of a radar system is 700ys, what is the PRF.    
==? PRF = 1 / PRP = 1 / (700 * 10-6s) = 1/7 * 10^4 = 10.000/7 = 1.429 1/s

PRP = 1000 pulses per second, what's it PRP in milliseconds
PRP = 1000Hz = 1000 1/s = 1000 /(10^3 * 10^-3s) = 1000/1000 * 1/(10^-3s) = 1/ms

### Pulse Width, Power, and Range

pulse power := power in each pulse.   
(more common) 'continous power' of radar = pulse power averaged over complete transmission cycle.

continuous power can be increased by    
+ boosting power when pulses are sent, and pulse length constant    
+ increasing pulse length

power affects range, because radar beams are never completely prallel, they expand out, and therefore the pwer per square meter reduces as the squeare of the range.

example: one way radar: signal range doubled. What happens to the reeived power per squeare meter?    
-> range doubled == pwer per squeare meter reduced by factor $2^2 = 4$ ==> it is a quarter of the previous received power.

CAUTION: questions about primary radar: signal travels both way!

example: for any given circumstances, in order to double the effective range of a primary radar the power output must be increased by a factor of?

==> to double range and keep power per square meter at target: increase transmitter power by $2^2 = 4$.    
==> signal has to travel back: keep return constant $4^2 = 16$

### Pulse Radar Maximum Range

envisaged range influences PRP as a long enough quiet period is required for the reception of the reflected signal.    
if PRP too short, the returning pulse would not arrive in the period when the radar was receiving, or, worse, it would arrive after the next pulse. => ambiguity (Alps south of Neuburg)

max. theoretical or unambiguous range of a pulse radar is affected by PRP (and PRF).   
Theoretical maximum range = $\frac{c}{2* PRF}$

example: PRF of a radar system is 400 PPS (pulses per second). What is the maximum range in NM?

max range = c / (2 * PRF) = 3 * 10^8 / (2 * 400) = 3/8 * 10^6 = 30/8 * 10^5 = 3,75 * 10^5 m = 375.000m = 375km ~ 200 NM

or use 3 * 10^8 m/s = 162.000 NM/sec = 162.000/800 NM = 1620/8 NM ~ 200 NM

ground radar with PRF of 450 pulses per second, what maximum range?    
MUR = c / (2 * PRF) = 300.000km/s / (2 * 450) = 300.000 km/s / 900 1/s = 300/900 * 1000 km = 1/3 * 1000km = 333km 

LOW PRF needed for LONG RANGE radars!

very short range, beginning of returning pulse can arrive before tht tail end of the puls has been transmitted => radar not yet switched to receive == no detection.

==> short pulse for short range radar.   
Thus pulse width or pulse length, affect the minimum range.

obvious design choice: short pulses and long PRP for short and long range.   
Unfortunately, long range systems need long pulses to keep the energy in the beam. :(

==> purpose built radar:    
short range radar ~ short pulse and high PRF    
long range systems ~ long pulse and low PRF

Note:   

minimum range controlled by pulse width.   
maximum range controlled by PRF, but also power.   
long range radars have a slow scanner rotation (to allow for signal return measurement)

factors affecting range of pulse radar:   

* transmitter power,
* PRP and PRF,
* pulse width,
* transmitter and target heights,
* clouds and rain (weather clutter), and
* intervening high gorund.

### Bearing and Range Resolution

bearing accuracy is controlled by the width of the radar beeam.   

beam width: $$beamwidth = 70 * \frac{wavelength}{antenna diameter}$$

-> the larger the parabolic dish aerials, the narrower the beams    
-> best resolutoin would come from combination  of high frequencies and large aerial.    

range resolution is controlled by pulse length.   
Short pulses produce good range resolution.

certain aerodrome sufrace movemment radar (ASMR) operate at such short wavelengths and have such narrow beams and high rotation rates, that it is possible to identify aircraft types from teturn - at least by size.

tight beams comf from high frequencies and big aerials.   
Good range resultion comes from short pulses.

### Factors Affecting Quality of Target Responses

* super refraction (ducting) := under certain conditions, VHF (and above) will behave in a manner that gives comparable ranges to sky wave propagation. If marked termperature inversion, and between that inversion and the ground there is a rapic decrease of humidity with heigth, the readio wave may be trapped under the inversion with little attenuation. ==> when high pessure systems prevail, signals in these bands may travel far beyound the normal direct wave range ~~ detection ranges of radars may be greatly increased.
* sub-refraction ~ caused by temperature and humidity, can be bent less than normal. detection range may therefore be consderably less than normal.
* attenuation with distance ~ dispersion of transmitted energy ~ weaker signal => no or faint radar response.
* condition and size of reflecting surface ~ amount of reflected energy from a target is dependent upon its size and shape of the refleccting surface, the material, and aspect of the target (ac fliying directly towards radar reflects less energy than one passing in constant range). During attitude changes, there can be signal polarisation change -> target fading / low response

### Ground based Radar

ground based radar allows for less separation between air traffic than procedural or non-radar services.  
ground based radar can also provide approach control and approach servie from cloud break to precision approach.   
ASMR at (busy) airports to observe and control aircraft movements on maneuvering area.

- surveillance radars
- precision approach radars, and 
- ASMRs.

### Aerials

rougnd radar aerials are either flat phase arays or parabolic sections designed to operation in two dimensions.    

where systems require elevation information, a 2nd parabolic section aerial is used scanning up and down in the vertical plance.

ground radars operate in 2 dimensionss (bearing and range)

### Moving Target Identification

option to include moving target indicator (MTI).   
Doppler shift from moving target and the lack of Doppler shift from stationary targets to distinguish and exclude those that are not moving, theoretically the ground clutter.

disadvantage of MTI ~ could exclude aircraft targets that are moving across the screen but neither towards or away from theradar head and therefore displying no Doppler shift.     
MTI is only used with primary radar systems.

### ATC Radar Displays

Modern ATC radars tend to use computer generated displays (synthetic displays) rather than 'raw radar data'.

### Surveillance Radar

enroute surveillance radar ~ 200-300NM range and good weather penetrating capabilities.   
Long range requirment: => low PRF with long pulses and lowish transmitted frequeency ~~ target resolution moderate !!!.

==> 2 radar systems are used together to meet this requirement.   
i) UHF primary radar on 600MHz with a wavelength of 50cm, pulse length of 4 ys, PRF 270 PPS, horizontal beam width 1.7deg, and an aerial rotation 5 RPM in conjucntion with a scondarry radar.

primary radar: bearing and range.   
secondary radar range, bearing, identification, altitude, etc from those targets quipped with a scondary radar transponer.

secondary radar is not susceptible to weather clutter, because it uses a different frequencies to transmit and receive.   
It is more likely to detect long range targets as the signal only travels onw way, not back and forth.   
secondary aerial: flat phase array.

### Terminal Surveillance Radar

terminal surveillane radars provide separation between airccraft withink the terminal aera during transit, approach and departure.  
May be used to provide a radar coud break.

Mediam range radar with maximum ranges up to 60 to 80NM.   
medium range ~ higher frequencies, higher PRF and faster scan rate for good tartet discrimination.

prim and secondary radar used together.   
primary radar is likely to operate in the top end of UHF 1000-1200Mhz with pulselength of 3.9ys, PRF 1350PPS, beam width 1,2deg and a rotation rate of about 8 RPM.   
Surveillance radar displayes for enroute and terminal aera are procedded throggh comuters to combine information from PSR and SSR.   
This can be superimposed on an airspace map for the contoller convenience.

MUR = c / (2 * PRF)    
60  = 162.000 NM/s  / (2 * PRF)   
2 * PRF = 162.000 / 60    
PRF = 162.000 / 120 = 16200 / 12 = 1350 PPS


### Approach Surveillance Radar

approach surveillance radar = short range primary radars capable of being used to provide guidance during intial, intermediate, and possibly final approach of flight.   
higher frequencies, PRF and rotation rates.

UHF/SHF ~ 3GhZ with a PRF of about 700PPS.   
Some approach radars have very short pulses of about 1 ys to allow them to operate to minimum ranges of as little as 150m.   
Rotation rates are about 15RPM.

can be used for surveillance radar approach SRA.  
During SRA ATCO provides headings to aircrew to about half a mile from touchdown.   
Controller has no view of the aircraft in the vertical plane and only advises the pilot on the heights that the aircraft should be passing.   
SRAs are flown on QFE unless the pilot requests a QNH approach or unless the normal comparny procedure is QNH. Altimeter checks are crucial.

SRAs are normally flown on QFE to MDH.

### Precision Approach Radar PAR

military   
radar consists of 2 elements: one for azimuth and one for elevation.   
both situation at approach end of runway near the toucdown point.   

10Ghz on a sector scan rather than a complete circular scan.


### Airfield Surveillance Movement Radar SMS

ASMR or ASMI operate at very short wavelength 0f about 3.8cm (SHF).   
Narrow beams with high rotation rates around 60RPM.


## Distance Measuring Equipment DME

slant range to ground station  
in general diff between slant and ground range 'minimal' (unless ac close to station)     
DMEs often co-located with VORs and with ILS to provide range information

DME secondary radar system = active component in ac and on the ground.   
DME UHF band, 960-1215MHz using line of sight propagation.

### principle of operations

ac transmits a stream of apirs of pulses to the ground station.    
2 pulses separated by 12 microseconds.   
after delay of 50 microsecs ground station transmits.   
range determined based on time delay between sending and receiving the pulses minus 50 microseconds.

ac := interrogator, ground := transponder (as it replies)

```{r}
#| label: fig-dme-principle

knitr::include_graphics("./figures/radionav-DME-principle.png")
```


### practical challenges

distinguish between i.) own and other ac pulses, and ii.) between retransmitted pulses from the transponder and its own interogator transmission reflected from ground.

own interrogation := each ac "own" random or 'jittered' PRF ~ time interval between the paired pulses is random, likelihood of two pulses identical ~ NIL.

transponder retransmits at a different frequency, 63MHz apart from interrogation ==> can differ ground reflected signal = ac receiver working on different frequency than transmitter/interrogator.

paired frequencies are called channels and there are 252 of them available, 126 in regular use designated as X channels and another 126 Y channels which can be allocated.

To make sure that the ground equipment is not triggered by other UHF transmissions such as mobile phones or SSR, it will only replay to pairs of pulses separated by 12 microsecs.

### Searching

PRF randomised, it averages out to about 150 pulse pairs per second when the aircraft starts to interrogate the DME, dropping to 60 pulse pairs per second after 15.000 pulse pairs.    
The airborne equipment searches through the possible ranges looking for a match for the pattern of pulse pairs that it sent, called 'time gates'.   
Once it found the PRF drops to about 24 pulse pairs a second and it is said to be 'locked on' or 'in tracking mode'.

The ac will start with its time gates at minimum range and then move the search out to longer ranges.   
Advantage of starging at minimum range is that you will always pick up the direct signal first, as any reflected responses from the ground station must arrive later.

### DME memory

memory function allows the range to continue counting down at the same rate, if the signal is temporarily interrupted.   
After 8-10 seconds off flag will come up, or - with an LED display - the range will not be displayed.

150 PPS for 15.000 pulse pairs, then 60PPS. Locks on at 24PPS.   
DME memory keeps the counters turning for 8-10 seconds after signal losss.

### Beacon Saturation

ground equipment has limited capacity and adjusts its gain to only hanlde the strongest 2700 pulse pairs.   
This means that only 18 searching aircraft can use the facility or 112 locked on aircraft.   
In practice, there is a bit of eah and about 100 aircraft can be served at once.

Note: DME ground equipment will answer the "strongest" signals, not the nearest ac.

### Squitters and "Auto Standby Mode'

ground transponder limited to receiving 2700 pulse pairs per second,    
it will transmit 2700 pulse pairs per second!   
if not saturated, it will make up the numbers with random pulse pairs := squitters.

ac interogator not active all the time.   
ac interrogator starts searching when it receives transmissions from the ground transponder, either replies to other aircraft or squitters.   
ac interrogator not active = "auto stand-by mode"

==> DME interrogations will not start until a signal is received from the ground transponer!

### Echo Protection Circuits

transponder repliese reflection from ground to ac -> time gates in ac receiver count up from zero range, i.e., only the first arriving reply is received.   
ac interrogations being reflected on their way to the ground, if acted on by ground transponder would result in false DME range.

principle: direct path interrogations must arrive first, and also the assumption that reflected pulses are likely to be weaker.   
After ground station receives valid pulse pair, it block any further lower amplittude pulse pairse from being receive for a very short time, about 150 microseconds := "echo protection circuit".   
Echo protection circuit - retriggerable blanking gate (RTBG).    
== all reflected interrogations are excluded.

### Accuracy

ICAO requires accuracy of 0.25NM plus 1.25%, 95% of occasions, in slant range measurement for systems installed before Jan 1989.   
Systems installed after that date must have a slant range error of less than 02.NM on 95% of occasions.   
=> DME most accurate ground short range NAVAID.

### Tactical Aids to Navigation TACAN

TACAN := military beacons operating in UHF band to give range and bearing information to equipped mil ac.   
UHF range of TACAN compatible with DME so that civilian DME users can also obtain range from a TACAN.

### VOR/DME Association

associated beacons are beacons with same ident.   
VORs and DMEs to be associated, they must be either less than 100ft (30m) apart, if used as terminal aid, or less than 2000ft (600m) if used for other purposes.   

assocaited TACANs and VORs are called VORTAC.

associated beacons send 3-letter ident morse code every 10sec.    
One comes from the DME, the next three from the VOR -> DME ident comes every 40 secs.   
Pitch of DME ident is higher that VOR ident at 1350Hz.

If beacons are not meeting critieria, i.e., not associated, they may be given similar but not identical idents.   
A DME within 6NM of an enroute VOR might have the last letter of its ident changed to Z, for instance: VOR := LIP, DME := LIZ.

### Frequency Pairing

DME channels (UHF) have paired VHF frequencies.   
Airborne equipment designed that channel is slected when VHF frequency is selected and the aircraft responds to the paired UHF DME interrogation.

Associated VOR/DME will be frequency paired.   
VOR and DME beacons that are not associated may still be frequency paired, if it is considered it would be useful.

ILS and DME transmitters may also be frequency paired so that selectiong the HVF ILS localiser frequency give paired UHF glideslop AND also the paired DME reading distance to run.

### Non-Standard Time Delays

delay at ground transponder of less than 50 microseconds will cause aircraft DME to UNDER READ, as the ac will still apply a correction fo the full 50 micreoseconds.

can be used, if single DME provides ranges to touchdown on two opposing runways.    
transponder placed next to the runway, exacltly between the two thresholds and mde to underread by haft a runway length.

A DME assocaited with an ILS in this way, will clearly only read correctly when on the approach, and so should only be sued inside the localiser coverage area up to 25.000ft.    
If DME cannot be placed exactly between the two threholds, it is zeroed to the main instrument runway and the other runway will have a note on the approach plte such as CAUTION: DME reads 0.1 NM at threshold! 

### Cockpit Equipment

DME is turned bu its paired VHF frequency, either VOR or ILS.   
Displays mechanical or electronic.

mechanical display: OFF flag across the range display - not lcoked on, if the counters are moving throughout their range, or that the power is off, if they are not.   
General Aviation ac tend ot use LED displays that do not have on OFF flag.

Transport ac, the DME is usually displayed on the EFIS ND and possibly also on a mechanical standy instrument which combines 2 RMI needles with a double DME readout (check for fig!).

### DME Range and DME Derived Groundspeed.

DME indicates slant range to the beacon, i.e., not the plan range.   
At long range, ~ distances greater than the aircraft height in thoughsed of feet in NM - the difference is negligible.

Pythogoras' theorem!

example: ac at 35.000ft is 18NM slant range. Find plan distance.

6080ft = 1 NM
35.000ft / 6080 = 5,7 NM

$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ <--> $b^2 = c^2 - a^2$
b^2 = 18^2 - 5.7^2 = 324 - 33 = 291
b = sqrt(291) ~ 17NM


some DME receiver use rate of change of DME to indicator groundspeed.   
These are only accurate flying to or from the beacon at some range, ideally at ranges greater than the aircraft height in thoughsands of feet.

GS indicators are most accurate flying to or from the beacon at long range and low altitudes.

### Symbology

DME only - squear with point    
TACAN or DME

### DME Fixing and DME Arcs

DME range can be used as part of an instument procedure to keep ac at constant range from beacon : = DME arc

DME arc can lead into an approach procedure and it can be used to join a hold.    
When DME arc procedure is used to enter a hold, it may only followed by Sector 1 or Sector 3 join.

### DME Fixing and DME ars

2 DME arc can be used to provide a range/range fix, called rho/rho fix.   

2 circular positions cut in 2 places (possible ambiguity)   
Typically "false" intersection usually "far enough away",

DME can be used with VOR to produce a range/bearing or rhot/theta fix.
DME/DME fix 'best' due to accuracy, DME/VOR next, VOR/VOR fix.

## Secondary Surveillance Radar SSR

basic SSR - mode A and C    
modern SSR - mode S; mode S also used by TCAS/ACAS

mode C and S replies are automatic, basic mode A identification code is set by aircrew: squawk 1234

contrary to DME, SSR ground station := interrogator, ac := transponder

interrogation pulses on 1030MHz with time spacing recognised by aircraft.   
ac transsponder longer train of pulses on 1090MHz

### Sidelobes and Sidelobe Suppression

ground transmission/interrogation: rotatin beam from phase array aerial => sidelobes next to main beam.   
aircraft response is omnidirectional.

to avoid sidelobe confustion, main interrogation suppresses sidelobe; main interrogation pulses in rotating beam but overlaying an omnidirectional pulse at an amplitude that is greaten than the sidelobes, but soncisrable less than the main beam.

Mode A and C use 2 pulses for main beam, i.e. P1 and P3, omnidirectional pulse P2 ==> intergogation received from a sidelobe would have lower amplitude than the omnidirectional P2 ~ could be identified as sidelobe == ignored by aircraft transponder, only replying to an interrogation where P1/P3 pulses are significantly higher amplitude than the P2.

### Pulse Spacing

P2 sent 2 microseconds us after P1 for Mode A and C.    
Sometimes called "control pulse".

Mode S sends the control pulse in a different place. But the principle is the same.

### Mode A and C

interrogation - interval between pulses 1 and 3 at ground interrogation dictates the sort of question that is asked, or the mode.

mode A  spacing 8 ys    civil and military identification/squawk
mode c  spacing 21 ys   altitude reporting

aircraft reply on 1090MHz is a stream of pulses 20,3ys long framed by 2 frame pulses.   
Deteween the frame pulses, there is space for 12 additonal pulses := 12 bit code.    
Pulse train ~ binary code in with 2^12 or 4096 possible number combinations can be sent.

response to mode A interrogation will be the code sent by the ac/squawk.   
mode C is pressure altitude - automatic - if selected.

ac altitude taken from digitisers on theback of the altimeer or from the Air Data Computer.   
It is independent from the altimeter subscale setting == always references 1013.25hPa (standard pressure) = pressure altitude transmitted in 12bit code in 100ft increments _/+50ft from actual ac altitude).

### Mode C Accuracy

ATCO FL -/+300ft of assigned level.   

if deviation, ATCO may request altitude reporting to be de-selected, or if fails, to squeaw 0000 to indicate a system malfunction.

some EUR states with variation from ICAO standard: errors to be less than 200ft.

Most ground equipment adjust the received pressure altitude to a QNH based altitude for display on radar screen (!????!!!!)

### SPI or Ident

additional identification pulse can be transmitted 4.35ys after the reply pulse train which causes the return on the readar scree to bloom (for 25 seconds).    

### Mode A/C errors

ac may respond to 2 ground interrogations.  
received replies may be for wrong station := **fruiting** ~ False Replies Unsynchronised to the Interrogaror Transmission FRUIT.    
Fruting causes display errors in both range and bearing.

If 2 ac are on same bearing from ground station and closer together than 1.7NM, they may produce overlapping replies to the ground interrogation := **garbling**.   
E.g. formation ~ only one ac, other transponders on standby.

Fruiting and garbling reduced with Mode S.

### Cockpit Equipment

ac transponder control unit

selector: OFF, SBY, ON, ALT, TEST    
IDENT button
key for squawk 0-7

ON - power on, system replies to mode A with selected code    
ALT - power on system replies to mode A interrogation with selected code and mode C (altitude readout)   
TEST - selftest.

### SSR Mode S

mode S overcomes deficiencies of mode A and C.

mode S provides over 16mio ICAO 24bit aircraft addresses; addresses allocated by respective state authority

mode S operates on principle that selective interrogations are sent to particular aircraft using specific ICAO aircraft addresses.    
mode S transponders store and are able to transmit on request hundreds of aircraft parameters and have datalink capability (ground initiated comm B (GICB)).

mode S operates on the same frequencies as mode A and C.   
Interrogator/transmponder backwards compaticble, i.e., ground station can interrogate a mode A ac and mode S ac will still provide mode A and C response to old-style interrogations.

mode S altitude reporting = can provide enhanced vertical tracking with 25ft increments

mode S interrogators have specific identification codes which they include in their transmissions := station identifiers SI codes and there are 63 of them.   
63 sufficient due to line-of-sight properties of UHF and unlikely to be 63 secondary stations in range of any one aircraft..

mode S capable of up- and downlink; required for TCAS I or II.


### Mode A/C/S All Call

mode S all call interogation starts of looking like Mode A or C interogation, but has a thrid extra pulse P4 after P3.

ac will switch to mode S, if it receives P4 with its aircraft address and call sign.

any mode A/C transponder receiving the all-call witll reply to the interrogation as normal, not recognising the P4 pulse.

once mode S transponder has been identified and its track established, it can be locked out to prevent it replying to any further all-call interrogations from stations with the same intrrogator code.    
It will then still repond to all calls from new stations with differing interrrogator codes but only reply to selective interrogations from the "active" ground stations.    
= reduce transmissions and possibility of interference.

Selective interrogations use the 24bit aircraft address and are only released when the radar beam is poiting to whare the aircraft is expected to be in the sky.   
Ac reply is Mode A code, the aircraft identification (call sign) and pressure altitude.

### Mode A/C only All-Call

an all-call can be sent to only mode A/C transponders by shortening the P4 pulse so that Mode S transponders to not reply.

some other shit stuff on Mode S (all calls etc.)

## Satellite Navigation

GNSS Global Navigation Satellite System := "accurate" & world wide navigation system.

* Navstar Global Poisioning System (GPS) ~ US DoD
* Global Orbiting Navigation Satellite System (GLOSNASS) ~ Commonwealth of Independent States (ex Soviet Union)
* Galileo ~ European Space Agency (ESA)
* Bei Dou (several iterations) ~ China

### GNSS segments

— space segment ~ constellation of satellites;
— control segment ~ master control station, ground antennas, and monitor stations, compute corrections of orbital parameters, and up/download data;
— user segment ~ receivers (typically on board of aircraft).

space segment ~ notional constellation := design minimum to make (GNS)system work.

### NAVSTAR GPS

notional constellation of 24 satellites orbiting earth in 6 near-circular orbital planes each at 55degrees to the equator.    
Each plane has 4 satellites orbitting at 20.200km (10.900NM) once every 12 hours.    
=> 5-8 satellites will always be in line of sight range of a receiver

satellite ground tracks only go up to 55deg North and South, but coverage is global due to their orbit height.

GPS has more satellites than the nominal minimum.    
Currently 31 => more than 4 satellites in each orbital plane and more than 5 satellites will be inevitably in view.

### Frequencies

GPS originally designed for US military = two frequencies in UHF.    
US convention 'bands' (than clusters of frequencies) => "L"-band, 1575.42 MHz (L1) and 1227.6MHz (L2).   
Control of the satellite is maintained by an uplink in the S-band.

military system uses both frequencies ~ "precise" possitioning service (PPS) and transmits a code called precise (P) or PY code.

system for civilian use is called standard positioning service (SPS) and designed to provide users with a deliberately less accurate positioing service than for military.   
It is known as the coarse acquisition signal (C/A) and is transmitted on the higher band, i.e., L1 at 1575.42MHz.

P code also transmitted on both frequencies.

### Timing and Timing Control

Timing of each satellite's transmission is controlled by four on board clocks.   
The time signal transmitted by the satellite is picked up by the moitoring stations around the world during its orbit and checked against atomic clocks in Master Control Station in California. ~ control segment.

Next to monitoring output and positions of the satellites, the control segment will upload corrections and database information to the satellites, and - if one stellite fails, mark it as 'unhealthy'.

L1 C/A and P code, L2 P code only.

### Principle of Operation

satellites transmit unique satellite identifier and the time at whchich the signal was sent.   
satellite identifier := long digital signal modulated on the satellite carrier wave using Binary Phase Shift Keying BSPK that looks like random noise, but is in fact a repeating pattern := "pseudo random noise" (PRN) code

PRN comprises    
* unique satellite identification
* time signal (used by receiver to calculate distance from satellite -> rangeß)

receiving equipment uses its internal electronic clock to measure how long the message has been in transit -> converts time delay into distance from the satellite = sphere of range centred on satellite.

ranges from 2 satellites ~ circular position line in 3 dimensions where the spheres intersect.   
==> ranges from 3 satellites are needed even for a two dimensional fix and either separate altitude information or a fourth satellite is needed for a 3-demensional 3D fix.   
As 5-8 satellites are usually inview - even with a notional constellation - a 3D fixing capability is normal.

ranging can be described as "trilateration" which strictly speaks about 3 satellites; while in fact 4 satellites are needed to determine a position.

### Pseudo Ranges

satellite clocks are very accurate, however, the clock in the receiver is not an atomic clock / only an electronic clock.   
Use of time together with speed of light, even small timing errors lead to bid distance errors.   
A timing error of a millonth of a second, equates to a range error of 0,162NM = NOT accurate!

Thus, due to receiver clock inaccuracy, the initial calculated range from the satellite is invariably inaccurate := pseudo range.    
receiver clock error called 'receiver clock bias'.

Pseude ranges from several satellites calculated by a receiver with clock bias would produce a poorly defined fix.

SOLUTION => aircraft receiver applies a small timing correction and looks to see if the fis is more precise = i.e., checks if the 3-D area of uncertainty is smaller
-> corrections repeated until a near pin-point fix is achieved.    
Iterative process ~ through a series of small (correction) steps.

iterative timing correction process runs continuously to keep the fixing as accurate as possible.   
Correction for receiver clock bias ensures that by the time a fix position is calculated, the receiver is completely synchronised to satellite time.

aircraft receiver must be aware of satellite positions.   
Expected positions are stored in receiver memory.    
Initial loading of database and (regular) update.    
These (and other data) is downloaded as a second part of the satellite signal called the NAV message.

Note: receiver clock bias is handled/resolved by receiver!

### NAV Message

message sent in 25 30-second data frames ~ total of 12 1/2 minutes.   
Individual data frames are used to "chunk" the data and therefore still useful, if the satellite is not inview for the whole 12 1/2 minutes.

* **almanac** ~ database that coarsely defines expected positions of tall satellites at any particular time - updated periodically - vlaid up to 180 dyas
* **ephemeris** ~ short term position information of the transmitting satellite ~ valid for 4 hours - used for fixing, detailed/precise position
* **satellite clock correction** ~ correction needed tfor timing signal from the transmitting satellite
* **UTC correction** ~ determines difference between GPS time and UTC; UTC has leap seconds applied from time to time - GPS does not! Delta currently 18 seconds.
* **ionospheric model** ~ mathematical model of Ionoshere to allow compensating for single largest error of GPS with is the dealy to the signal as it passes through the ionosphere, based on 11 year solar cycle.
* **satellite Heath Status** ~ identifies satellite as healthy (usable) or unhealthy (unusable).

### WGS84

Receiver uses ephemeris data to work out the positions of the tranmitting satellite in 3 axes relative to the centre of the earth.   
The calculated fis is also initially expressed relative to these acex with an additonal parameter, i.e., time := :delta T.

X,Y, Z, and delta T fix position is then referenced in the receiver to the WGS84 ellipsoid => $\rho$, $\lambda$, and altitude position before finally preseented as LAT, LON, and Height.

CAUTION: old maps that have not been corrected to the WGS84 dataum = show positions several hundred meters out from GPS!

### Velocity

low end GPS reeivers comute velocity from the change in receiver position over time ~ accuracy in order of meters a second.    
Sophisticated receivers use Doppler shift on the received signal, compute out the satellite velocity in 3 dimensions and are left with the receiver velocity to accuracy of centimeters a second.

### Time to First Fix

purpose of Almanac = when receiver is first turned on, it looks for satellites where it expects to find them according to the almanac,and based on the time and its last known position.    
If receiver has been moved a long way simnce it was last used, it gets confused and has to search the sky to determine which satellites are overhead: This can take up to 4 or 5 minutes.    

Once satellites are identified, the position is computed from the more accurate ephemeris data.    

Time to first fix can be shortened by entering a position, time, and date to give the receiver a new starting datum and shorten the search for the satellites.

### User Equivalent Range Errors

achieved accuracy of raw GPS signals varies around the world and with time, typically less than a meter on 95% of occasions for civilian user.   

Several system errors are classified as User Qquivalent Range Errors (UERE):

* ionospheric propagation delay ~ variations in ionospheric density and atmospheric conditions are the largest individual source of error. Satellites that are overhead have the least errors, and provide the most accurate ranges. Satellites close to horizon produce the most inaccurate ranges.     
Delay in transmission caused by ionosphere and atmosphere is proportional to $\frac{1}{f^2}$, f being the carrier wave of the signal.   
Military receivers operate on 2 frequencies can compare the delays on their two frequencies to compute a near total correction for the ionospheric error.    
Civilian receiver on 1 frequence L1 cannot make use of this method and relies on mathematical model of the inosphere which is downloaded from sattellites as part of the data message.   
Reduces error by about 50% and was one of the ways by which the US DOF made the SPS inherently less accurate when it was initially released.

2nd frequencies are now being provided along side the P codes on L2 allowing suitably equipped multi=frequency civil receivers the same level of accuracy as the military. These are called L2C.

* satellite orbital variation ~ orbital variations or ephemeris error occur when the satellite is not exactly where it says it is. caused by solar winds, changes in Earth's gravitational field, or gravitaional effects of the sun and moon.    
Control of position is so stringgent that errors ccaused by ephemeris error account for -/+0.5m.    
Howerver, spotting and correcting ephemeris error can take up to 3 hours.

* instrument/receiver error ~ caused by electical moise, computational errors, or errors arising when matching the pseude random signals. Erros in range from this source are small for specialist receivers, but in less sophisticated mobile phone equipment facurracy can drop from 1m to 5m.

* multipath signals ~ signals reflected from terrain can be confused with direct signals and degrade accuracy by several meters. The error arising from multipath signals can be reduced by aerial desigin and software fixes, but may still be present when operating at low level mountainous terrain.

* satellite clock error ~ timing errors at the receiver willlead to initial fixing errors, but receiver clock bia can be corrected out. Errors at the satellite are less likely, but more serious as these can be only corrected as the satellites pass over the master control station.

### Satellit Geometry Error DOP

strictly speaking not a GPS error, but error based on principle of using position lines to obtain a fix.    
Optimum geometry for 4 satellites is to have 3 separated by 120 degrees in azimut and elevated a little above the horizon with a 4th directly overhead.    
If satellites are close together, the angle of cut between the range lines withl be shallow and the fix is liable to be less accurate.

GPS fixing dilution of precision DOP or geometric dilution of precision GDOP.   
Position errors up to 70m can occur.

DOP comprises 4 components:

* PDOP - position dilution of precision in 3D - sometimes called spherical DOP
* HDOP ~ horizontal dilotion of precision (latitude and longitude)
* VDOP ~ vertical dilution of precision - height
* TDOP ~ time dilution of precision ~ time.

While each of these DOP terms can be individually computed, the are not indiependent of each other.   
A high TDOP causes receiver clock errors that result in increased position errors.

DOP can be expressed numerically from 1...20.   
1 := ideal; 20 := poor.

Computed value of UERE combined with a predicted dOP allows for an estimation of position accuracy.

Geometric dilution of precision is caused by "shallow cut" of the position spheres.   
Low DOP factor is good (ideal 1), high factor is bad (worst 20)

### Coverage Problems

GPS signals "weak", satellites only powered by batteris and solar panels -> weaker when received (travelled).   
GPS easy to jam - either accidentially or deliberately transmitting on the same frequency.   
accidental: transmissions are sometimes harmonics from similar frequencies such as UHF television broadcasts.

Areas of no GPS coverage may be referred to as "worm holes" and wehre they can be anticiapted these are notified by NOTAM.

Deliberate and un-notified GPS jamming can occur near airfields when truck drivers park up for the night and switch on short range GPS jamming devisec to stope their employers to track them (?!?)


### GLONASS

space segment - the GLONASS system is similar in operation and design to GPS. 
Fully operational 24 satellites orbit the Earth in 3 orbital planes, with 8 satellites in each orbit equally displaced by 45 degrees of latitude.

The satellites in each plane are each 15 degrees out of sync with those in the next plane.    
This ensures that only 1 satellite crosses the equator at any one time, not three together.   
The near circular orbits are inclined at an angle of 64,8 degrees to the equator with the satellites flying at a height of approx 19.100kn, lower than GPS.   
As the orbit is lower, the orbital time is 11hours 15 minutes.

GLOSNASS satellites orbit faster and slightly lower than GPS.

### GLOSNASS System Status

24 operational satellites => at least 5 satellites should be in view from any position on earth.   

ALthough many non-aviation and some aviation civilian receivers can use both GPS and GLONASS together, which increases both the number of satellites and frequencies available.   

EASA: GLONASS may not be used in aviation applications.

SYSTEM OPERATION

user segment calculates range from satellites ~ GPS.   
Reference system different: GLONASS positioninformation is calculated using the PZ-90 earth-centred earth-fixed reference system which basis its position on the average position of the geopgraphic north pole between 1900 and 1995.

### GALILEO

ESA equivalent to GPS/Navstar.   
EASA approved use of Galileo together with GPS in multi-constellation GNSS aviation receivers.

Galileo works ~ GPS.   
Notional constellation is 27 satellites in 3 active spares.   

3 orbital planes, inclined at an angle of 56 degrees to the equator.   
The altitude of the orbit is 23.222km, higher than GPS and therefore the orbital period is longer than GPS at 14hours.

Galileo satellites orbit slower and slightly higher than GPS.

FREQUWNCIES: Galileo use the same frequencies and carry an identifier at part of the navigation message.   
Satellite navigation signals are transmitted in 3 band in UHF, on of which also contains the GPS L1 frequency.

SYSTEM OPERATION - ranging principle ~ GPS and GLOSNASS.   

3 service levels

* open service OS ~ accurace comparable to GPS C/A signal
* coomercial service CS - available for fee - uses additional 3rd frequency band E6 to provide higher level of accuracy than OS fixing to 1m
* public regulated service PRS; accuracy comparable to OS but more securely for use by security forces and ATC

Galileo satellites are also able to pick up and report signals from search and rescou beavons operating on 406MHz.

RECEIVERS AND AERIALS = user segment

multi-channel receivers = modern aviation receivers are multi-channel, i.e., they are able to listen simultaneously to a number of satellite transmissions. up to 200-400 channels, can use all satellites in view from multiple constellations.

mask angles = satellite not considered visible until it is above the horizon, typically 5-15 degrees. At low altitude satellites suffer from ionospheric and atmospheric delay.    
Angle called mask angle and is specific to each receiver.

older receivers ~ small mask angle, built before there were fewer satellites ~ able to pick up poor signals.    
modern receivers ~ higher mask angles, 10-30 degrees above the horizon, and many allow to adjust the mask angle by the user.

### Aerial Location

receiver aerials are positioned on the top of the fuselage ßto give a clear view of the sky, and generally near the centre of gravity.    
~ best/regular view to sky/satellites.
