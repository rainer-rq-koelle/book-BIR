## Radio Theory

production: oscilating electrical current & aerial   
electrons moving for- and backwards produce electromagnetic field    
field moves away with speed of light

aerial ~ transducer = transforming enery from one type to another: alternating current to free electromagnetic wave = 'radio frequency (RF) energy'

in receiving aerial -> current identical to the originating

transmitter -> tranmitter aerial ~~~ receiving aerial -> receiver -> amplifier -> headset

### Frequency and Wavelength

electromagnetic waves characterised by frequency or wavelength.   
speed of light constnat (in vacuum) 3 * 10^8 m/s

alternating current that cycles once in a second will produce one wave in that time -> wavelength

$$\lambda = \frac{c}{f}$$
doubling frequency -> half the wavelength

note for exam questions: speed of light 3 * 10^8 m/s ~ 300.000 km/s ~ 162.000NM/s

  f $\lambda$

radio signal, freq 3 kHz -> what is the wavelength?     
3kHz = 3000Hz    
$\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3 * 10^8}{3 *10^3} = 10^5 m = 100.000m = 100km$

wavelength of 3.5cm -> what is the frequency?
$f = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{3*10^8}{3.5}*\frac{\frac{m}{s}}{cm}$ = 3*10^8 / 0.035 = 8.57GHz

Equipment Extremely High Freq   EHF   30-300GHz     1cm-1mm   milli-metric

### Phase and Phase Difference

phase angle := positions on a radio wave are expressed in degrees from 0 ... 360    
by definition, measurement of phase angle starts when aomplitude is increasing through zero

in phase = two transmissions with same wavelength/frequency start at same time ~ synchronised.    
out of phase = difference, delta expressed in degrees

note: signals can be in phase with different amplitude, however, wavelength or frequency identical

phase comparison, same wavelength   
avoid cancelling out of signals (i.e., if out of phase by 180deg)

modulation = additional of information to a carrier wave (or transporter)
= process of impressing and transporting infomation by radio waves

modulation can be achieved by i) changing amplitude, ii) changing frequency, or iii) phase of the signal

AM = Amplitude Modulation ~ simplest form of modulation = variation of amplitude of the carrier wave to transmit information

Sidebands   
modulation = imposing intelligence on carrier wave = "heterodyning"   
when 2 frequencies are heterodyned => 2 additional frequencies are created on top of the original carrier wave = sidebands

example: AM signal, carrier wave 400kHz, intelligence of 1 to 3 kHz   
lower side band: 400kHz - 1 kHz & 400kHz - 3kHz

SSB = single sideband transmission = removal of carrier wave and sideband ~ lower power requirement and reduced bandwidth, by convention only the lower sideband     
short range VHF communication systems  DO NOT remove carrier wave.    
long range HF communication systesm use SSB (with suppressed carrier wave)

### Frequency Modulation

instead of varying amplitude, change of wave frequency

FM receiver can clip signal to remove extraneous variations in amplitude.  
FM audio signal = high fidelity reproduction of the original without interference from static.

mixture of frequencies more complex than AM, (virtually) impossible to strip out sidebands   
thus: FM => higher bandwidth, require more power (than AM SSB signal)    
FM transimission requires about 3 times the power required for AM SSB   
and twice the bandwidth

to avoid frequency congestion, FM signals restricted to low power and thus SHORT ranges (becuase of higher bandwidth occupied)

advantage: less static noise/interference
disadvantage:   
  + greater power requirement
  + greater bandwidth, and
  + more complex transmitting and receiving equipment
  
### Phase Modulation

phase modulation allows for the sending of information in form of instantaneous variations in the phase of the carrier wave.   
== Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)

PSK is used in GPS systems, in wireless local area networks LAN, and for bluetooth communication.

### Sending Binary Information

simplest form: morse code

typically achieved by interrupting := keying carrier wave to send a series of dots and dashes.    
~ pulse modulation (morse code, radar)

increasing information needs, more complex binary signals and pulse modulation = Amplitude Shift Keying ASK

FM for digital signals the sidebands are smaller than when sending for instance audio signals, and therefore the disadvantes of FM are less prominten.    
Using FM for digital transmissions is called Frequency-Shift Keying FSK.

Simpest form of phase-shift keying is Binary Phase Shift keying BLSK. This transmits digital information by simply reversing the phase of the carrier wave.

example: binary signal of zeros and ones    
ASK uses an interruped carrier wave (e.g. for the ones)    
FSK varies the frequencies for ones and zeros     
BPSK reverses the phase at every change from one to zero or vice versa.

### Emission Classification

radio transmissions are classified by a three digit ITU code:    
  1. symbol := modulation
  2. symbol := type of modulating signal
  3. symbol := type of information carried
  
NDB    
  NON carrier without modulation
  A1A carrier with keyed morse code modulation
  A2A carrier with amplitude morse code
  
A3E carrier with amplitude modulated speech used for VHF communication

### Polarisation

radio waves are composed of 2 elements: i) electrical or E field, and ii) magnetic field at right angle to electrical field, called H field    
E and H-fields are thus orthogonal and in phase.

vertical polarised wave is a wave in which all the electrical oscillation (E-field) is in the vertical plane.    
Vertical aerial will produce vertical polarised wave requiring a vertical aerial to receive it.   
In analogy, horizontal one will produce horizontally polarised waves.

VHF communication frequencies are vertically polarised and the aircraft aerial are vertical.    
Navigation frequenices (e.g. VOR) are horizontally polarised and the aerials are horizontal, often in V shapre on the fin of the aeroplane.

### Aerials

diploes := simplest aerial vertical or horizontal conductor, the orientation depending on the polarisation, with a length of half the wavelength to be transimitted or received.    
dipole areial ~ $\frac{\lambda}{2}$

monopoles (or single pole) aerial size is effectively half a dipole and therefore has an ideal size of a quarter of the wavelength for optimum efficiency.

top view: ciruclar / omnidirectional ~ aerial transmits equally in all directions.  
side view: monopole aerial transmits well horizontally, but there is an aread overhed where there is no transmission (cone of silence) = no signal.

ideal dipole aerial is half or quarter of the wavelength   


VHF ~ metric band, vertically polarised, with wavelengths from 10m to 1m ==> monotpol receiving aerials placed on the top of the aircraft ~ signal path to/from antenna is not obstructed by parts of the aircraft (top antennas), Length about 2.5 and 25cm.   

VOR aerials are dipoles in the same frequency range, and signals are horizontally polarised.    
=> V shaped aerials on the fin of the aeroplane, each half being a quarter wavelength and therefore in total making up a half wave diploe.

Antenna Shadowing = positioning of aerials is important as the received signal strength is reduced is there is either another aerial or physical obstrauction in the line-of-sight path.   
Another aerial in the way takes energey from the radio wave as it received the signal leaving less for the aerial behind to detect.

### Parabolic Aerials

oldest generation of directional aerials/antenna ~ mathematical shape of parabol => capture of "pencil beam" (or "conical beam")   
not 100% efficient     
generate sidelobes and backscatter, the more efficient, the lower sidelobes and back scatter/energy loss.    
about 2/3 or energy can get lost in sidelobes.    
refrlections from sidelobes can cause interference and confusion to a directional signal.

groubd based radars often make use of kust a section of the aerial to track in only two dimensions.    
The beam is comparatively tight in the horizontal plane, but would not have much definition in the vertical pane.

parabolic antenna typically ground based primary radar systems and aircraft weather radar.

### Phase Array Aerials

modern alternative to parabolic dish = phase array aerial ~ series of conducting elements like small dipoles are arranged in a line and are fed signals in phase with each other.   
interference pattern they produce acts like a pencil beam.

sidelobes are still present, but the advantage of phase array aerials over parabolic aerials is that the energy loss in sidelobes is less to a 1/3 of the total.

examples:   
PSR (parabolic) and SSR (phase array)

slotted scanners or slotted planar arrays ~ (function like) phase array aerials   
vertical dipoles elements are replaced by a series of slots which act as resonante cavities to produce the radio signal.   

reduced energy loss ~ more energy concentration in tighter beam.

most modern aircraft use slotted planar arrays.

note: all dish aerials produce sidelobes. Phase array and slotted planar arrays produce smaller sidelobes.

## Wave Propagation

### Refraction

change in density will result in refraction ~ higher density slower   
amount of refraction ~ change in speed, its frequency, and angle at which it hits the new medium.

change in speed := refractive index (e.g. glass ref ind = 1.5, the higher the freq, the higher the refraction)   
in Ionosphere (refractive index < 1, higher refraction for lower frequencies!)

radio waves are refracted (speed change) due to surface (passing over) or because of the medium they are passing through

### Diffraction

wave passes through a hole ~ circular waveform past the hole    
hole acted as point source and retransmitted the wave

diffraction also happens when passing over sharp objects.

diffraction is greater at longer wavelengths ~ low frequencies

### Reflextions and Re-Radiation

specular reflection ~ simple reflection (mirror like)   
reflection dependent on density and smoothness of reflecting surface material and angle

smooth surface ~ mirror     
rough surface ~ reflection in all directions := diffuse reflection

note: surface reflection dependendent on wavelength/frequency

radar systems -- reflection is an integral part of design -- some return is specular, but most comes from small parts of the taerget airacraft structure acting as little receiving aerials which re-radiate the transmission.    
This effect happens also with water droplets in weather radars.   
Design caution to ensure radar wavelength compatible with target size, i.e. same size or smaller as target.

radar reflection is most likely when the wavelength is compatible with the target size!

### Attenuation

attenuation := loss of signal strength of a (electro-magnetic) wave.    
in vacuum ~ no attentuation   
in atmosphere -> electrions in dust and water droplets absorb some of the energy

atmosphereic attenuaation increases wtih increasing frequency, significant above 1 GHz    

surface attenuation := radio waves passing over Earth's surface loose energy and slow down    
surface atttnuation is greatest and speed is lowest over the ICE CAPS, then desert areas, then over other land, and there is least attenuation over SEA

surface attenuation increases as frequency increases (just at atmospheric attenuation); both affected by same substances, rock and water.

Waves passing through electrically charged atomes at the edges of space known as the ionosphere are also attenuated:   
HOWEVER: ionospheric attenuation increases as frequency decreases


### Space Wave

space wave := line-of-sight wave = standard propagation of all frequencies; range limited by obstructions and curvature of Earth surface.

VHF and EHF only propage with space wave => limited in range.    
Ground reflected waves are also included in this category.

maximum theoretical range of a space wave in UHF or VHF in NM 

$$max_theo_range = 1.23 \sqrt{H_1} + 1.23 * \sqrt{H_2}$$
H1 = height of transmitter, and H2 height of receiver, in FEET ft
range in nautical miles NM

example:   
aircraft at 8000ft communication to ground station. What is max theoretical range of the signal?   

H1(aircraft) 8000ft, ground station (assumed) 0ft/MSL    
max theoretical range = 1.23 (sqrt(0) + sqrt(8000)) = 1.23 * sqrt(80 * 100) ~ 1.23 * (9 *10) = 1.23 * 90 ~ 110NM

### Surface Waves

at lower frequencies, radio waves pass over hills and buildings and are diffracted. 
Effect increased by slower wave front near Earth's surface caused by ground conductivity (resulting in downward component of movement ~ pull to surface).    
=> surface wave follows curvature of Earth

diffraction greatest at low frequencies -> low frequencies tend to form surface waves    
travel distance dpendent on surface attenuation which is lowest at low frequencies and over sea.    
==> surface waves are longest for low(est) frequencies

surface waves    
  + HF band ~ 100NM
  + MF band ~ 500NM
  + LF band ~ 1000NM
  + VLF band ~ 4000NM
  
surface waves and space waves will occur at short range and the combination is called: "ground wave".

surface wave propagation not affected by time of day.

### Sky Waves

sky waves are radio waves refracted from Ionosphere.    
Ionosphere - ionised component of atmosphere ranging from 60-400km above the surface and divided in 3 layers, i.e. D, E, and F layer.

Depth and density of each layer varies with time of day, season and solar activity.

Ionosphere ~ gas molecules (normally with no electrical charge) are split into positive and negative ions.   
Density of ions increases with height and intensity of readiation (solar and cosmic radiation).   
Ionosphere is weaker at night than during day due to change of solar radiation.

Change of ion density -> refraction of radio waves (medium change).    
Most refraction occurs at 125km = E layer.    
Wave of low enough frequency at the correct angle of incidence will be refracted back to earth.     
Some refraction also at F layer.

VHF and higher are certainly refracted if they pass through the Ionosphere, but are not bent enough to come back to Earth.    
I.e., sky waves do not occur at all at VHF and higher frequencies.


### HF Skywaves

lower frequencies = higher refraction in Ionosphere, HF refracted back to Earth as skywave.

minimum skip distance := distance from transmitter to first returning (refracted) skywave; for HF typically 600-1200NM    
near transmitter, HF propagates as space wave and surface wave ~ 150NM

==> area between the end of the sufrace wave range and the first returning skywave (between 150NM and 1000NM) where no signal is received.   
"dead space" or "skip zone".

skip distances increae at night ~ weaker ionosphere ~ less ino density due to lower radiation/no solor radiation => less refraction.    

maximu skip distance occurs when the signal leaves the Earth at a tangent, refracts from the Ionosphere, and returns at a tangent to the Earth's surface.    
Maximum theoretical skip distance from the E layer is about 1500NM.

Note: longer distances due to "multi-hop transmissions" due to Earth refractions/retransmission.

### ML/LF Skywave Interference

ML/LF refract more from Ionosphere = reduced skip distance.
MF/LF have longer surface waves ==> no dead space/skip zone at all around 300-400NM.

==> receiver will pick up both: surface wave and (first returning) skywave which may interfere with each other.

interference: different travel distances ~ variation in phase possible == amplified signal or cancellation.

typically Ionosphere signals move continuously in and out of phase (= increases and decreases) ~ fading == indication that the signal has taking  two paths to the receiver.   

During daytime: signals passing through Ionosphere are subject to inospheric attentuation, greatest at low frequencies.   
==> MF and LF are more attenuated that HF ==> interference unlikely during daytime.   
==> higher fading during night-time (i.e., between dusk and dawn) ~ weaker Ionsophere and associated attentuation.

Skywaves are    
  + reliable in the HF band 
  + do not (normally) occur at VHF and higher
  + cause interference in MF/LF
  
Skywaves are used in HF voice communication and also in HF as part of the ACARS messaging system (long-range communication).

### Sporadic E

skywaves do not "normally" occur in VHF, but intimes of very high solar activity the E layer is much more heavily ionised that usual, called "sporadic E.    
Thus, it becomes dense enough to generate returning skywaves in the lower VHF band.

Unusual, but can lead to unexpected long-range reception in VHF.

### Atmospheric Ducting

Given "right conditions", VHF, UHF, SHF and EHF bands can get "trapped" within a layer in the atmosphere := atmospheric duct.

Atmospheric duct allows for long range propagation over the visual horizon (= atmosphereic ducting or super-refraction).

Near surface ducts ~ marked temperature inversions and a rapid decrease in humidity with height.    
Air mass subsidence (surface high pressure) systems can produce elevated ducts.   

Atmospheric ducting generally unpredictable.     
But, "always" some ducting that extends line-of-sight by about 15%. This is accounted for in the range formula for VHF and UHF.

atmospheric sub-refraction = where atmospheric refraction is less than normal -> causes reduced maximum theoretical range. 

### VLF Propagation

VLF wavelengths in order of tens of kilometers and low frequencies that normally no skywaves will form and completely attenuated by the Ionosphere.    
Surface waves are present up to 4000NM.

Ranges beyond 400NM are formed in VLF because the gap between Ionosphere and Earch acts as natural waveguide.    
This can happen when VLF wavelength is similar to gao height (lower levels of Ionosphere)

Ionospheric ducting := combines very long surface waves with guided waves to reach around the world.

### Static

static interfere with radio signals making communication difficult in HF band and interfering with the operation of navigation equipment.

statis is a natural phenomenon caused by electrical discharges in convective clouds.
Thunderstorms generate huge amounts of electricity and these discharges affect the lower frequencies, becoming insignificant in the VHF band.

MF/LF static can "swamp" signals from NAV beacons in those frequencies, i.e., NDBs => indicators in aircraft point to thunderstorm rather than the NAV beacon.

**precipitation static** when precipitation - particularly rain - strikes aircraft at a different electrical potential, there is a minute discharge of static.   
Again most troublesome in LF and MF bands.

rule of thumb: static and skywaves are unlikely above 30MHz.


### Doppler Effect

sound: change in pitch of engine noise as car passes observer    
water/beach: change in facing waves when moving in or out of water

change in received frequency = Doppler Shift    
Doppler shift proportional to the relative velocity    
indifferent to tranmitter or receiver moving (or both)

+ closing relative velocity produces increase in frequency, i.e., positive Doppler shift
+ if the transmitter and receiver are moving apart, the received frequency is lower, i.e., negative Doppler Shift.

Doppler shift is a small change to the tranmitted frequency, even for jet aircraft.   In most systems small enough to be within bandwidth.    
However, sysgem can be built to "look" for this shift.

Doppler Navigation systems use the Doppler shift in reflected signals to compute the groundspeed and drift of the aircraft.   
More sophisticated systems use this combined with heading from the compass system to compute the aircraft's track and ground speed  providing position readouts.

While mostly superseeded by satellite navigation and intertial navigation, Doppler navigation systems can still be found in some older helicopters.    
Doppler is also sometimes used for hover control.

Doppler is used   
+ some VOR beacon (called Doppler VOR)
+ identify moving targets in some forms of ground based radar called Moving Target Indicators (MTIs)
+ to identify areas of turbulence in some weather radars, and
+ (as one of two methods) to determine receiver's speed in satellite navigation.

### Propagation Summary

+ atmospheric and surface attenuation are greatest at high frequencies
