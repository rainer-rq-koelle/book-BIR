## Radio Theory

production: oscilating electrical current & aerial   
electrons moving for- and backwards produce electromagnetic field    
field moves away with speed of light

aerial ~ transducer = transforming enery from one type to another: alternating current to free electromagnetic wave = 'radio frequency (RF) energy'

in receiving aerial -> current identical to the originating

transmitter -> tranmitter aerial ~~~ receiving aerial -> receiver -> amplifier -> headset

### Frequency and Wavelength

electromagnetic waves characterised by frequency or wavelength.   
speed of light constnat (in vacuum) 3 * 10^8 m/s

alternating current that cycles once in a second will produce one wave in that time -> wavelength

$$\lambda = \frac{c}{f}$$
doubling frequency -> half the wavelength

note for exam questions: speed of light 3 * 10^8 m/s ~ 300.000 km/s ~ 162.000NM/s

  f $\lambda$

radio signal, freq 3 kHz -> what is the wavelength?     
3kHz = 3000Hz    
$\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3 * 10^8}{3 *10^3} = 10^5 m = 100.000m = 100km$

wavelength of 3.5cm -> what is the frequency?
$f = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{3*10^8}{3.5}*\frac{\frac{m}{s}}{cm}$ = 3*10^8 / 0.035 = 8.57GHz

### Phase and Phase Difference

phase angle := positions on a radio wave are expressed in degrees from 0 ... 360    
by definition, measurement of phase angle starts when aomplitude is increasing through zero

in phase = two transmissions with same wavelength/frequency start at same time ~ synchronised.    
out of phase = difference, delta expressed in degrees

note: signals can be in phase with different amplitude, however, wavelength or frequency identical

phase comparison, same wavelength   
avoid cancelling out of signals (i.e., if out of phase by 180deg)

modulation = additional of information to a carrier wave (or transporter)
= process of impressing and transporting infomation by radio waves

modulation can be achieved by i) changing amplitude, ii) changing frequency, or iii) phase of the signal

AM = Amplitude Modulation ~ simplest form of modulation = variation of amplitude of the carrier wave to transmit information

Sidebands   
modulation = imposing intelligence on carrier wave = "heterodyning"   
when 2 frequencies are heterodyned => 2 additional frequencies are created on top of the original carrier wave = sidebands

example: AM signal, carrier wave 400kHz, intelligence of 1 to 3 kHz   
lower side band: 400kHz - 1 kHz & 400kHz - 3kHz

SSB = single sideband transmission = removal of carrier wave and sideband ~ lower power requirement and reduced bandwidth, by convention only the lower sideband     
short range VHF communication systems  DO NOT remove carrier wave.    
long range HF communication systesm use SSB (with suppressed carrier wave)

### Frequency Modulation

instead of varying amplitude, change of wave frequency

FM receiver can clip signal to remove extraneous variations in amplitude.  
FM audio signal = high fidelity reproduction of the original without interference from static.

mixture of frequencies more complex than AM, (virtually) impossible to strip out sidebands   
thus: FM => higher bandwidth, require more power (than AM SSB signal)    
FM transimission requires about 3 times the power required for AM SSB   
and twice the bandwidth

to avoid frequency congestion, FM signals restricted to low power and thus SHORT ranges (becuase of higher bandwidth occupied)

advantage: less static noise/interference
disadvantage:   
  + greater power requirement
  + greater bandwidth, and
  + more complex transmitting and receiving equipment
  
### Phase Modulation

phase modulation allows for the sending of information in form of instantaneous variations in the phase of the carrier wave.   
== Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)

PSK is used in GPS systems, in wireless local area networks LAN, and for bluetooth communication.

### Sending Binary Information

simplest form: morse code

typically achieved by interrupting := keying carrier wave to send a series of dots and dashes.    
~ pulse modulation (morse code, radar)

increasing information needs, more complex binary signals and pulse modulation = Amplitude Shift Keying ASK

FM for digital signals the sidebands are smaller than when sending for instance audio signals, and therefore the disadvantes of FM are less prominten.    
Using FM for digital transmissions is called Frequency-Shift Keying FSK.

Simpest form of phase-shift keying is Binary Phase Shift keying BLSK. This transmits digital information by simply reversing the phase of the carrier wave.

example: binary signal of zeros and ones    
ASK uses an interruped carrier wave (e.g. for the ones)    
FSK varies the frequencies for ones and zeros     
BPSK reverses the phase at every change from one to zero or vice versa.

### Emission Classification

radio transmissions are classified by a three digit ITU code:    
  1. symbol := modulation
  2. symbol := type of modulating signal
  3. symbol := type of infomation carried
  
NDB    
  NON carrier without modulation
  A1A carrier with keyed morse code modulation
  A2A carrier with amplitude morse code
  
A3E carrier with amplitude modulated speech used for VHF communication

### Polarisation

radio waves are composed of 2 elements: i) electrical or E field, and ii) magnetic field at right angle to electrical field, called H field    
E and H-fields are thus orthogonal and in phase.

vertical polarised wave is a wave in which all the electrical oscillation (E-field) is in the vertical plane.    
Vertical aerial will produce vertical polarised wave requiring a vertical aerial to receive it.   
In analogy, horizontal one will produce horizontally polarised waves.

VHF communication frequencies are vertically polarised and the aircraft aerial are vertical.    
Navigation frequenices (e.g. VOR) are horizontally polarised and the aerials are horizontal, often in V shapre on the fin of the aeroplane.

### Aerials

diploes := simplest aerial vertical or horizontal conductor, the orientation depending on the polarisation, with a length of half the wavelength to be transimitted or received.    
dipole areial ~ $\frac{\lambda}{2}$

monopoles (or single pole) aerial size is effectively half a dipole and therefore has an ideal size of a quarter of the wavelength for optimum efficiency.

top view: ciruclar / omnidirectional ~ aerial transmits equally in all directions.  
side view: monopole aerial transmits well horizontally, but there is an aread overhed where there is no transmission (cone of silence) = no signal.

ideal dipole aerial is half or quarter of the wavelength   


VHF ~ metric band, vertically polarised, with wavelengths from 10m to 1m ==> monotpol receiving aerials placed on the top of the aircraft ~ signal path to/from antenna is not obstructed by parts of the aircraft (top antennas), Length about 2.5 and 25cm.   

VOR aerials are dipoles in the same frequency range, and signals are horizontally polarised.    
=> V shaped aerials on the fin of the aeroplane, each half being a quarter wavelength and therefore in total making up a half wave diploe.

Antenna Shadowing = positioning of aerials is important as the received signal strength is reduced is there is either another aerial or physical obstrauction in the line-of-sight path.   
Another aerial in the way takes energey from the radio wave as it received the signal leaving less for the aerial behind to detect.
