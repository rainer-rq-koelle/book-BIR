## ACAS   

ACAS also known as traffic collision avoidance system TCAS    
based on Mode S transponders to provide traffic information to aircrew.

ACASII provides collision avoidance in the vertical plane.   
Resolution Advisories RA are system-based and may conflict with ATC instructions.
RA ==> collision avoidance command.

Traffic Advisory TA information on proximate traffic and traffic that is potentially threatening.
TA ~ enhance situational awareness, possibility of a RA, assist in visual acquisition of traffic.

E.g. G1000 offers option for TCAS

## Flight Rules

### Cruising Levels

cruising levels are based on magnetic track (projected path) not the magnetic heading!
semi-circular cruising levels; 000-179 & 180-359 --> opposite traffic is separated vertically.

Minimum separation between flight levels is 500ft. (IFR/VFR)

In polor regions, i.e., above 70N or 70S, grid tracks aligned with the Greenwich Meridian may be used instead when prescribed by the relevant authorities.   
In other states, e.g., New Zealand, Italy, Israel, France, ..., with predominantly NORTH-SOUTH airway tracks, the semi-circular levels may be based on southbound tracks defines as between 090-269 and nothrbound 270-089.

Figure shows non-RVSM airspace/cruising levels.

## Aerodromes

ICAO Annex 14 --> SARPS for aerodromes intended for international traffic.   
Local / regional variations may exist - but in principle "same" standardised markings, terminology, and lighting.

aerodrome components    
supporting buildings, apron, and maneuvering area.

maneuvering area = part of aerodrome used for take-off, landing, and taxying of aircraft EXCLUDING aprons.    
taxiways are defined paths for taxying aircraft and provide links between different parts.  
runway = defined as rectangular area for take-off and landing of aircraft.   
apron = defined area intended to accommodate aircraft for the purpose of loading or unloading passengers, mail, or cargo, and for fueling, parking, or maintenance.

runway design    
* non-instrument runways intended only for aircraft using visual approach procedures, and
* instrument runways intended for aircraft making instrument approaches as well as visual approaches. Instrument runways can be further sub-divided into
  + precision approach runways := runways served by ILS and/or MLS precision approach airs
  + non-precision approach runways := runways provided by an approach air with at least directional guidance for a straight in approach (e.g. NDB)
  
runway holding positions     
aircraft should hold at designated runway holding position, or 50m from runway edge where runway is 900m or more, 30m from runway where runway length is less than 900m.

runway strips    
runway strip is an area which includes the runway and the stopway.   
Strips are intended to reduce damage to aircraft running off the runway and to protect aircraft flying over it on take-off or landing.

a strip should extend before the thrrshold and beyond the end of the runway or stopway for a distance of at least:     
* 60m where the code number is 2,3, or 4;
* 60m where the code number is 1 and the runway is an instrument runway; and
* 30m where the code number is 1 and the runway is a non-instrument runway.

runway width     
A strip including a precision approach runway should - wherever practicable - extend laterally to a distance of at least     
* 150m where the code number is 3 or 4; and 
* 75m where the code number is 1 or 2     
on each side of the runway centre line or the runway and its extended centre line throughout the length of the strip.

grading of runway strips      
that portion of a strip of an instrument runway within a distance of at least:    
* 75m where the code number is 3 or 4; and 
* 40m where the code number is 1 or 2    
from the centre line of the runeay and its extended centre line should provide a graded area for aeroplacnes which the runway is intended to serve in the event of an aeroplane running off the runway.    

The surface of the strip which abuts a runway shall be flush with the surface of the runway and should be prepared against blast erosion in order to protect a landing aeroplance from danger of an exposed edge.

runway end safety areas    
a runway end safety area is a semi-prepared surface at the end of a runway designed to reduce the damage if an aircraft lands short or over runs the runway.    
ICAO recommends that a runway and safety area should extend from the end of a runway strip for as great a distance as practicable, but at least 90m.   
It should be at least twice as weide as the associated runway.

### reported data

aerodrome data is reported in the AIP in text and also on the ICAO aerodrome chart.   
Short term information such as work in progress and runway conditions may be reported by NOTAM.

reported data includes:    
* ARP aerodrome reference point = designated geographical location of the aerodromes. The ARP should be at or near the actual or planned geometric centre of the aerodrome.
* ELEV aerodrome elevation is the highest point in the landing area where the landing area is defined as that part of the movement area intended for the landing or takeoff of aircraft.
* declared distances
  + declared distances are the offical published data for the various distances required for takeoff and landing calculations
  + stopway and clearway
    + stopway is defined as rectangular area on the gorund at the end of the take-off run available prepared as a suitable area in which the aircraft can be stopped in the case of an abandonned takeoff. The stopway should be at least as wide as the runway.
    + clearway is a rectangular area on the ground under the control of the aerodrome authority which is selected or prepared as a suitable are over which an aeroplane may make a portion of its initial climb to a specified height. The clearway may not be greater than 50% of the tuake off run available and should extend at least 75m either side of the centre line.

Note: a stopway has to be load bearing whereas a clearway does not. It could be water.

### displaced threshold

Where a runway has a displaced threshold, the LDA will be reduced by the distance the threshold is displaced.

### runway contaminents

runway contaminents can include:
* water
* snow
* slush
* ice
* anti-icing or de-icing fluid
* mud
* dust
* sand
* volcanic ash
* oil, and
* rubber.

### braking action

braking action shall be reported if the runway is contaminated with snow or water.

measured breaking coefficient   estimated breaking action   code
0.4 and above                       good                     5
0.39 to 0.36                        medium to good          4
0.35 to 0.3                         medium                    3
0.29 to 0.26                        medium to poor            2
0.25 and below                      poor                      1


## Aerodrome Markings

markings - Annex 14 Aerodromes ~ 

markings typically "painted" on to surfaces in maneuvering area    
signs and markers have vertical extent

### Markings

runway marking shall be white. runway marking requirements are shown on the following page --> get fiture.

taxiway markings and aircraft stand markings shall be yellow.

apron safety lines must be a conspicuous colour which contrasts with that used for aircraft stand markings.

pre-threshold area - the paved area preceding a displaced threshold is marked with white arrows when suitable for normal use for take-off but not for landing.

runway designators - markings should be shown at the thresholds of paved runways. The marking shows the magnetic alignment of the runway in 2 digits to the nearest one tenth of magnetic azimuth.     
parallel runways: runway designator supplemented by a letter: L, R, or C.

In the unuual case of four paralle runways, one pair would be designated 28L and 28R, and the second pair would take the next nearest digit, 29L and 29R.     
Up to six runways can be named using this convention and L,R, and C.

aiming point marking - an aiming point marking must be provided at the approach end of a paved instrument runway where the code number is 2,3, or 4.   
The aiming point must be positioned no closer to the threshold than:    

LDA                 dist from threshold
less than 800m        150m
800m to 1200m         250m
1200m to 2400m        300m
more than 2400m       400m

runway lengths usually fall into the 3rd category, making the normal distance 300m.   
If the runway is equipped with a visual approach slope indicator, a VASI or PAPI installation, the aiming point must correspond to the origin of the visual approach slope.

runway threshold markings - runway threshold marking consists of a pattern of longitudinal stripes of uniform dimensions disposed symmetrically about the centre line of the runway     
The number of stripes depends on the ruwnay width:    

runway width    number of stripes
18m               4
23m               6
30m               8
45m              12
60m              16

touchdown zone markings - touchdown zone markings must be provided in the touchdown zone of a paved precision runway where the code number is 2,3, or 4.    
The markings can be either pairs of single lines either side of the centre line every 150m or the single lines can be replaced with first a pair of tripple lines, then a pair of double lines, and then a pair of single lines.     

The number of pairs relate to the LDA or - when both ends of the runway are marked - the distance between the thresholds:    

distance between thresholds   pairs of marking
less than 900m                1
900m to 1200m                 2
1200m to 1500m                3
1500 to 2400m                 4
more than 2400m               6


Other runway and taxiway markings    
* taxiway holding position (solid and dashed lines) = last holding position before runway
* "gatter": CAT II and III holding position
* intermediate holding positions can be estalished where needed. That taxiway marking is a yellow dotted line across the taxiway accompanied by a position identification marker or marking in yellow on a black background.

taxiway identification markings - painted on surface, possibly arrows

mandatory instruction markings - mandatory instruction markings may be used where it is impractical to use signs.
The marking must be white lettering on a red background and painted on the taxiway straddling the centre line on the taxiway side of the holding point. (e.g. runway identifier)    
except of a NO ENTRY marking the content of madatory instruction markings will be idetical to the corresponding signs.    

A NO ENTRY sign is the familiar horizontal white bar and circle with a red background as used on the road. NO ENTRY marking is the words NO ENTRY in white on a red background.

ILS/MLS marker board - runway holding position that aircraft or vehicle will not infringe the obstacle free zone, approach surface, take-off climb surface or ILS/MLS critical/sensitive area or interfere with the operation of radio navigation aids.

Information markings - where required. Locations are shown in yellow on black and directions are shown black on yellow.  

Signs ... are used for mandatory instructions and information.     
Must be rectangular, frangible/breakable, and sufficiently low to preserve propeller tip clearance and engine pod clearance for taxying aircraft.

Mandatory instruction signs use white text on red background.   
The are only used to show a point beyond which either a taxying aircraft or vehicle must not preceed without authorisation.    
Mandatory instruction signs include: runway designation signs, CATi/II/III holding position signs, runway holding position signs, road holding position signs, and NO ENTRY signs.

Signs must be illuminated    
* when runway is less than 800m
* at night when associated with instrument runway
* at night when associated with on-instrument ruwnays with code 3 or 4; and
* when intended for use at night in association wiht non-instrument runways, when the code is 1 or 2, signs may either be illuminated or reflective.

## Aerodrome Lighting

Annex 14 stipulates criteria for aerodrome lighting, including approach lighting, and visual flightpath guidance lighting in form of VASIs and PAPIs.    
Aircraft lighting is governed by Annex 2.

### aerodrome beacon

aerodrome beacon required , if aerodrome used for night operations and if   
* aircraft navigate by predominantly visual means;
* reduced visibility is a frequent occurrence; or
* it is difficult to locate the aerodrome fomr the air of surrounding lights or terrain.

aerodrome beacon = flashing light = every two to three seconds    
either white or green and white alternativne.

if an aerodrome is intended for use at night and cannot be easily identified from the air by other means an identification beacon must be installed.     
The identification beacon will flash a two or three letter code in Morse identifying the aerodrome.    
* green - civil aerodrome
* yellow - civil water aerodrome
* red - military aerodrome

both types of aerodrome beacon are now rare. Where they exist they be listed in the AD section of the AIP.

### Lights

structure: elevated runway, stopway, and taxiway lights must be frangible.   
Their height shall be sufficiently low to preserve clearance for propellers and for engine pods of jet aircraft.   

Elevated approach lights and their supporting structures within 300m of the threshold
must be frangible.


intensity - must be compatible with the nearest section of approach lighting.   
Separate intensity contols must be provided for compatibility with    
* approach lighting systems
* ruwnay edge lights
* runway threshold lights
* runway end lights
* runway centre line lights
* runway touchdown zone lights
* taxiway centre line lights


operation - all ground lights must be operated    
* continuously during the hours of darkness after the end of evening civil twilight unthe the beginning of morning civil twilight;
* when required for the control of air traffic; and
* at any time when their use, based on weather conditions, is considered desireable for the safety of air traffic.

Lights on and in the vicinity of aerodromes that are not intended for en-route navigation pruposes may be turned off, if no likelihood of regular or emergency operations exist, provided that they can be brought into operations at least one hour before the epected arrival of an aircraft.

### Vehicles

obstacle lights displayed on emergency or security vehicles must be flashing blue.
Obstacle lights on all other vehicles must be flashing yellow.

### Apporach Lighting Systems

lighting system dependent on appraoch category of the runways:    
* simple (non-precision) approach lighting system
* precision approach CAT I lighting system; or
* precisions approach CAT II or III lighting system.

approach lights shall be fixed variable white lights.

CAT II and  III lighting systems are not in the BIR syllabus.


Simple approach lighting system = row of lights on the extended centre line of the runway extending, whenever possible, for not less than 420m from the threshold.    
A row of lights form a crossbar 18m or 30m in length 300m before the threshold.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/inst-simple-approach-lighting-system.jpg")
```

simple approach lighting system may serve:    
* non-instrument runway intended for use at night where the code number is 3 or 4
* non-precision approach runway
* precision approach runway CAT I runway, but only when it is physically impracticable to install a precision approach CAT I lighting system.

fixed lights, normally white, but the colour of the lights shall be such as to ensure that the system is readily distinguishable from other aeronautical ground lights, and from extraneous ligting, if present.   
Each centre line shall consist of either     
* a single source, or
* a barrette (i.e., three or more ground lights closely spaced together to appear as a bar of lights) at least 3m in length.

Precision approach CAT I lighting     
precision apprach CAT I Lighting = row of lights on extended centre line of the runway, whenever possible, for 900m from the runway threshold with a row of lights forming a crossbar 30m in length at a distance of 300m from the runway threhold.     
CAT I lighting can be improved by having a total of 5 crossbars spaced 150m apart.
= "Calvert system"

crossbar = perpendicular, bisected by line of centre line    
lights of crossbar must be spaced as to produce a lenear effect, except that gaps may be lefton each side of the centre line.   
Such gaps to be kept at minimum, not exceed 6m.

lights forming centre line must be plaed at 30m intervals with the innermost light located 30m from threshold.

the lighting system must lie as nearly as practicable in the horizontal plane passing through the threshold, provided that     
* no object other than an ILS or MLS azimuth antenna protrudes through the plan of the approach lights within a distance of 60m from the centre line of the system; and
* no light other than a light located within the central part of a crossbar or a centre line barrette (not their extremeties) is screened from an approaching aircraft.

Any ILS or MLS azimuth antenna protruding through the pane of lights must be treated as an obstacle and marked and lighted accordingly.

### Runway Lead-in Lights

ruwnay lead in lights are used to define the desired approach path.

Where groups of lights are used, they must be arranged so that each group can be sighted from the preceding group and the interval between groups should not exceed 1600m.    
Lead-in lights may be curved or straight. Each group of lights shoud consist of at least three flashing white lights in a linear or cluster configuration. 
The system may be augmented by steady burning gaseous discharge lights.    
Where practicable, the lights should flash in sequence towards the runway. The most famous example of this is at JFK.

### Runway Edge Lights

runway edge lights must be fixed lights showing variable white, except that:    
* in case of a displaced threshold, the lights between the beginning of the runway and the displaced threshold must show RED in the approach direction; and 
* a section of 600m or one third of the runway length, whichever is less, at the fare end of the runway from whicht the take-off run is started may show yellow.

### Runway Threshold Identification Lights

unidirectional flashing white lights may be used to give added conspicuity to the threshold of a non-precision approach runway or to a dispalced threshold on a precision approach runway.

located symmetrically about the centre line, in line with the threshold and approx. 10m outside each line of runway edge lights.


### Threshold Lighting

runway threshold lights are placed as near to the end of the runway as possible, and no more than 3m from it.    
Wing bar lights are provided on a precision approach runway when additional conspicuity is considered desrirable and on a non-instrument or non-precision approachrunway where the threshold is diplaced and ruwnay threshold lights are required but not provided.   
Each wingbar is formed by at least 5 lights extending at least 10m perpendicular to the line of the runway edge lights with the innermost lights of each wingbar in the line of the runway edge lights.     
runway threshold and wing bar lights are fixed unidirectional lights showing green in the direction of approach to the runway.

### Runway Centre Line Lights

runway centre line lights are white from the threshold to 900m from the end of the runway, they they alternate red and white from 900m to 300m from the end, then become red for the last 300m.

### Runway End Lights

runway end lights are fixed red unidirectional lights facing the landing aircraft.

### Runway Guard Lights

ruwnay guard lights in 2 configurations

config A
* shalle be provided at each taxiway/runway intersection associated with a runway intended for use in 
  + RVR conditions of less than 550m where a stopbar is not installed; and
  + RVR condistions between 550m and 1200m where traffic density is heavy.
  
config B: shall be located at places where a holding bay, runway holding position, or road holding position would normally be located.

## VIsual Flight Path Guidance

### PAPI

precision approach path indicator (PAPI) system is made up of one bar of 4 eaually spaced lights on the left hand side of the runway or - more normally - two bars of lights either side of the runway, 4 lights in each bar.

above all                 white
slightly above            wwwR
on or close to approach   wwRR
slightly below            wRRR
below approach slope      RRRR

### APAPI

The abbreviated PAPI consists of a bar of two lights located on the left side of the runway, or more usualy on both sides of the ruwnay.

for a single PAPI indicator on the left   
above           ww
on/close        wR
below           RR

### T-VASIs

The T-VASI consists of 20 lights unit, 10 on either side of the runway.   
The form a cross shape with six lights in line with the runway and four across in a bar. (~ landing T)

too high = 4 lights in each bar show white with one, two, or three white lights visible beyond it.    
on path ~ the number of lights visible beyond the bar decreases until - on the correct path - only the four white lights of the bar are visible.

when below the approach path - four lights in the bar show red with one tow or three red lights visible in front of the bar (dependen on how far below)

### AT-VASI

an AT VASI is made up of ten lights units arranged on one side of the runway in a cross shape with six lights in line with the runway and four across in a bar.

Effectively one half of a T-VASI installation either on the left or right side of the runway.

T-VAISs and AT-VASIs are mostly found in Australia.

## Taxiway Lighting

aerodrome for low visibility operations GREEN centre line lighting is fitted on taxiways, other wise taxiways use blue edge lighting.   FOLLOW THE GREEN    
Most CAT II and III aerodreomes have both.

Where centre line taxiway lighting is used, additional centre line lights may be used to lead on to or off the runway centre line.    
In this case, the runway exit markings must be laternating yellow and green to the edge of the ILS sensitive area and green aftr that.    
If the same taxiway is used to enter the ruwnay they shoudl show green throughout for an aircraft entering.

A stop bar is a row of unidirectional red lights acorss the taxiway at a aholding point.    
When stop bar lights are on all aircraft must stop at that holding point and may not proceed until the red stop bar lights have been switched off.

## Departure Procedures

PANS OPS (Doc 8168) entails additional recommendations regarding aircraft operations.   
PANS are not (formally) part of the 19 Annexes of the Chicago Convention.   
Thus, PANS are not SARPs.    
However, PANS are widely accepted as the definitive operating procedures:    
* Volume I   - flight procedures
* Volume II  - construction of visual and instrument flight procedures
* Volume III - aircraft Operating Procedures.

"All 3 volumes cover operational practices that are beyond the scope of SARPs, but with respect to which a measure of international uniformity is desirable." (introduction of Vol I)

Vol I describes the operational requirements for flying the procedures designed in accordance with the criteria provided in Volume II.

Vol II is intended for the guidance of procedure specialists and describes the essential areas and obstacle clearance requirements for IFR.   
Provides basic guidance for States, and those operators, and organisans producing instrument flight charts that will result in uniform practices at all aerodromes where instrument flight procedures are carried out.

Vol III describes operational procedure recommendations for the guidance of flight operation personnel and flight crew.


### Ensuring Obstacle Clearance

both departue and arrival routes are based on defined tracks and the area around theose tracks ensures terrain and obstacle clearance.

An obstacle identification surface (OIS) is a defined surface intended for the purpose of determining those obstacles considered for the planning of a departure route and climb gradient or the calculation of obstacle clearance altitude/height for an approach proceufure.

Obstacle clearance volume: A volume of airspace is established which guarantees clearance from obstacles.    
Obstacle clearance volume is divided into 2 main areas:    
* primary volume for "full obstacle clearance"
* secondary volume outside the primary volume where decreasing obstracle clearance is provided.

The width of the obstacle clearance volume increases as the distance from the runway increases.   
Dependent on minimum clearance requirements and departure gradient, "procedure design gradient PDG (default 3.3%) or the approach gradient.     
PDG is made of 2.5% of obstacle identification plus 0.8% increasing obstacle clearance.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/airlaw-moc-protected-area.jpg")
```

primary area (track guidance) symmetrically about the nominal flight track in which minimum obstacle clearance MOC is provided.   
total width = primary area (1/2 of tatal width) + 2 * secondary area (each 1/4 of total width) 

### Accuracy of Fixes

routings / track guidance are based on defined tracks.    

fix tolerance area ~ aircraft "precise" position cannot be established, but falls within the tolerance area.

Intersection Fix  - the dimension of an intersection fix are determined by the accuracy of the navigational system used to define the fix.

     when providing track guidance   when NOT providing track guidance
VOR         5.2 deg                         4.5 deg
ILS         2.4 deg                         1.4
NDB         6.9 deg                         6.2

error margin/uncertainties represent overall system inaccuracy including aircraft equipment and displays.

Other fix tolerance Factors    
* surveillance radar - radar fix accuracies are based on the radar mapping accuracies, azimuth resolution, flight technical tolerance, controller technical tolerance, and the speed of the aircraft   
  + terminal area radar (TAR) within 37km/20NM: fix tolerance -/+ 1.5km/0.8NM
  + en-route surv radar (RST) within 70km/40NM: fix tolerance -/+ 3.1km/1.7NM
  + DME: -/+ 0.46km/0.25NM + 1.25% of distance to the antenna
  + VOR: fix tolerance heading over a VOR is based upon a circular cone of ambiguity extending 50deg to either side of the vertical
  + NDB: fix toleratnce overhead an NDB is based on an inverted cone of ambiguity extending 40deg either side of the facility.


### RNAV - Area Navigation

Area navigation equipment tends to be more accurate than basic fixing and can be based on either VOR/DME information, satelitte systems, inertial systems or combination of these.

RNAV based on VOR/DME --> aircraft equipped with RNAV systems approved by the State of the Operators for the appropriate level of RNAV operations (approaches and/or deprtures).    
Conditions:    
* RNAV equipment is serviceable
* pilot/crew know(s) how to operatre equipment to achieve optimum level of navigation accuracy, and
* published VOR/DEM facility upon which the procedure is bases is serviceable.

Accuracy dependent on computer for conversion of navigational data, calculation of track and distance, and steering guidance to next waypoint.    
Disadvantage: way-point and in some cases, data contained in the vaigational database have been calculated and promulgated by States and inserted by the opertor or crew.   
However, the computer cannot identify data input errors.   
Furthermore, computer designed to minimise errors and not affecting accuracy, the actual computed position will contain any errors introduced into the navigational database.

VOR/DME RNAV dependencies         
* ground station tolerance
* airborne receiving system tolerance
* flight technical tolerance
* system computation tolerance
* distance from reference facility.

GNSSS based RNAV Equipment    
SBAS bases RNAV equipment
  + SBAS approved for departure procedures; guidance material for arrival procedures "in the making" but exist!
  
RNP Operations - required navigation perfromance (RNP) standards define an airafts's capability to navigate accurately by its fixing accuracy.    
RNP 0.3 == aircraft can fix to an accuracy of 0.3NM total system error TSE on 95% of occasions.    
RNP (often based on RNAV) however requires additional on-board monitoring of TSE and alert process if TSE is exceeded.

RNP approaches and departures can be conducted on the basis of regional air navigation agreements --> approved by State and RNAV system approved for promulgated RNP.   

Routes may comprise segments with different RNP values.    
The segment with the lowest RNP vlaue is the most demanding one for the flight.   
Before a flight, pilot/aircrew must verify that the aircraft is able to meet RNP requirements for each segment.   
Might require update of aircraft navigation system before take-off.    
During flight: pilot must check sytem compliance with RNP requiremetns of the current segment.


### Baro VNAV

baro VNAV equipment is the Vertical Navigation element of an FMS with an additonal barometric altitude input into the FMS.    
Can be applied to 2 different approach and landing operations:    
* approach and landing operations with vertical guidance - lateral guidance is based on the required navigation procedures (RNP), approach (APCH) specifications and baro VNAV is required.
* non-precision approaches - baro VNAV is not required but is used to assist the continuous descent final approach CDFA technique

### Departure Procedures

The minimum obstacle clearance MOC for a straight departure in the primary area is "zero" at the departure end of the runway (DER) and increases from that point to 0.8% of the distance flown.    
This assumes turns through no more than 15 deg.   
If turns through more than 15 deg are planned a **turning area** is constructed.   
The MOC in the turning area is at least 90m/294ft.

If the departure route goes across mountainous terrain, the MOC may be increased.

### General Criteria

Departure procedures are designed with the assumption that all engines are operational.   
Operators are responsible to publish engine failure procedures and these may differ from the published departure by including, for instance, an emergency turn.

The design of instrument departure procedure is dictatated by the terrain surrounding of the aerodrome, but may also need to consider ATC requirements.    
These factors in turn influence the type and sitting of navigation airds in relation to the deparure route.    
Airspace restrictions may also effect the routing and sitting of NAVAIDs.   

The use of automatic take-off thrust control systems (ATTCS) and noise abatement procedures will need to be taken into considration by the pilot and the operator.

### Straight and Turning Departures

straight departure = initial departure track is within 15 degs of the alignment of the runway centre line    (figure showed 150m = 75 + 75 symmetrical to threshold)

turning departue = if departure route requires a turn of more than 15 degs to avoid obstacle(s). Such routes may contain a maximum speed restriction to contain the radius of the turn.     
If an aircraft requires a higher speed, then an alternative departure procedure must be requested.

Turns may be specified at an altitude/height, at a fix or at a facility.   
If the turn is not at a fix or facility, guidance information from a VOR or NDB must be acquired within 10km after completing the turn.

### Departure Routing

Standard instrument departures (SID) includes specific routing, usually to link up with airway routes.

Where such a routing is not required and there are no significant obstacles, the departure procedure may be to fly straight ahead to a defined height and then turn as required on to any desired track.    
This is known as an **omnidirectional departure**.

Where no suitable NAVAIDs are available, the criteria for omnidirectional departures are applied.

The minimum procedure is to maintain the runway extended centre line until reaching a height of 120m/394ft and then turn on track.    
For helicopters, the minimum height is 90/295ft.

### Departure Routing - Obstacles

if additional height for obstacle clearance is needed, the straight departure can be continued to a greater height.

Where obstacles exist, the procedure may identify sectors for which either a minimum gradient or a minimum turn altitude/height is specified, e.g. climb straight ahead to ALT 3000ft (on QNH xxxx) before commencing turn to sector 0 to 180 degrees.

Where obstacles do not permit development of omnidirectionsal procedures, it is necessary to    
* fly a departure route SIB; or
* ensure that ceiling and visibility will permit obstacles to be avoided by visual means.


### Promulgation of Departure Procedures

Details of any required departure procedure are to be notified withink the relevant Aerodrome AD pages of the AIP:

* general procedures - local traffic regulations
* details of NADP - noise abatement departure procedures, including altitude/level above which such procedures are no longer applicable
* specific departure procedures, including references to any SIDs or omnidirectional departures
* charst depicting generic departure procedures, including NADPs
* individual charts depicting specific omnidirectional depatures and SIDs (are to be published)
* where depatures procedures are limited to specific aircraft categories, the applicability of such procesures must be clearly statned on the procedure chart

Additional RNAV Procedure Requirements    
Such additonal requirements for RNAV procedures are detailed in PANS OPS and EUROCONTROL TNAV procedure design guidance material.    
Experience has highlighted the need for clear and unambiguous RNAV procedure descriptions and charts to be published in AIPs.   
In order that commercial navigation database providers can accurately code the procedrures without mistinterpretation or error.   
An unclear or ambiguous procedure description may result in database providers interpreting and codeing the procedure in a manner different to that intended, with the result that the aircraft may fly on widely differing profiles.

## Approach Procedures

Doc 8166 PANS-OPS   
instrument approach procedures consists of up to 5 segments    
* arrival
* initial
* intermediate
* final, and
* missed approach

Whenever possible, a straight-in approach will be specified which is aligned with the runway centre line.    
In case of non-precision approaches a straight-in approach is considered acceptable, if the angle between the final approach track and the runway center line is 30deg or less.   

All published procedures depict tracks and pilots should attempt to maintain the track by applying corrections to heading for known wind.

### Obstacle Clearance

MSA - minimum sector altitude or TAA terminal arrival altitudes are established for each aerodreome and provide at least 300m (984ft) minimum obstactle clearance within 25NM of a specific point.    
The full area may be divided into sectors based on **magnetic track**.    

For the MSA, the 25NM radius centres on the homing facility associated with the approach procedure for that aerodrome.   
For TAA, the 25NM centres on the initial approach fix IAF or in some cases the intermediate fix IF.    
TAA is intended for use with RNAV procedures and - where published - replaces the MSA.


### Aircraft Approach Categories

aircraft performance --> airspace and needed visibility for instrument maneuvers.    
most important factor: speed.

speeds quoted are 1.3 times the stall speed in landing configuration at maximum certified landing mass

category H    helicopters
category A    less than 91kts IAS
category B    91kt to 121kt IAS
category C    121kt to 141kt IAS
category D    141kt to 166kt IAS
category E    166kt to 211kt IAS

instrument approach chart specifies the categories of aircraft for which the procedure is approved.    
procedures designed to provide protected airspace and obstacle clearance for airfraft up to and including category D.    
Given airspace requirements, procedures may be restricted to lower speed categories.  
Alternatively procedure may specifiy a maximum IAS for a particular segment without reference to aircraft category.

### OCA/OCH

each approach procedure has a published obstacle clearance altitude/height (OCA/OCH).   
precision approach and circling approach a OCA/OCH is published for each category of aircraft.

precision approach: ILS, MLS, GLS, or PAR    
non-precision approach:  ILS LOC only, SRA, VOR/DME, VDF, NDB/DME, or NDB

OCA/OCH is     
* for a precision approach procedure or approach procedures with vertical guidance (APV) the lowest altitude (OCA) or the lowest height (OCH) above the elevation of the relevant runway threshold at which a missed must be initiated to ensure compliance with the appropriate obstacle clearance criteris
* for a non-precision approach procedure, the lowest OCA or lowest height above aerodrome elevation or elevation of the relevant runway threshold, if the threshold elevation is more than 2m/7ft below the aerodrome elevation, below which the aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriate obstacle clearance criteria; or
* for a visual (circling) approach procedure, the lowest altitude OCA or lowest height above the aerodrome elevant below which an aircraft cannot descend without infringing the appropriat obstacle clearance criteria.

### Operational Minima

minima ~ cumulative effect of a number of operational factors ==> OCA/OCH    
in the case of precision approaches, decision altitude DA or decision height DH   
non-precision approaches: minimum descent altitude MDA or minimum decision height MDH

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/air-oca-och-factors.png")
```


Additional limits are given for each type of approach.    
For ILS approaches, the decision height DH and runway visual range RVR limits are   

CATI     DH 200ft    RVR 550m    or visibility 800m
CATII    DH 100ft    RVR 300m
CATIIIA  DH 0ft      RVR 200m
CATIIIB  DH 0ft       RVR 50m
CATIIIC  DH 0ft       RVR 0m

### Arrival Segment

standard arrival routes STAR start at a fix (radio nav aid or waypoint) and 
show routing from that point to a fix or facility used in the procedures, usually the initial approach fix IAF.

if published, STAR, the width of the associated obstacle clearance volume decreases from the en-route value until the initial approach value with a convergence angle of 30deg each side of the axis.    
This convergence begins 25NM before the IAF.

obstacle clearance in the primary area is a minimum of 300m (984ft)   
omnidirectional or sector arrivals can be provided taking into account minimum sector altitudes MSA.    

At the end of a STAR, the IFR flight will not be cleared for an initial approach below the appropriate minimum altitude, unless    
* the pilot has reported passing an appropriate point defined by a radio aid;
* the pilot reports that the aerodrome can be kept in sight;
* the aircraft is conducting a visual approach; or
* the aircraft's position has been positively determined by use of radar.

primary area: a defined area symmetrically disposed about the nominal flight track in which the minimum obstacle clearance is provided.

### Initial Approach Segment

the initial approach segment starts at IAF and ends at intermediate fix IF.

aircraft maneuvers to enter intermediate approach segment.   
aircraft speed and configuration will depend on the distance from the aerodrome and required descent.   
initial approach segment provides at least 300m (984ft) obstacle clearance in primary area.

initial approach segment may be quite short or it may include reversal procedures called procedure turns or base turns, racetrack procedure to lose height or to position the aircraft inbound to a facility when a reversal procedure is not practical.

maximum angel of intercepting of initial approach segment    
--> normally track guidance is provided along the initial approach segment to the IF with a maximum angle of interception of    
* 90deg for a precision approach; and
* 120deg for a non-precision approach

### Reversal Procedure

a procedure designed to enable aircraft to reverse direction during the initial approach segment of an instrument approach procedure.    
The sequence may include procedure turns or base turns.

45/180
* facility - straight leg with track guidance, timed or limited by a radial or DME distance, fix
* 45deg turn
* times traight leg without track guidance, 1 min for CAT A & B, 1 minute 15sec for CAT C,D,and E)
* 180 turn to intercept inbound track

80/260 turn    
* facility - straight leg with track guidance which may be timed or limited by a radial or DME distance
* 80deg turn
* 260deg turn in the opposite direction to intercept inbound track

procedure turn - a maneuver in which a turn is made away from a designated track followed by a turn in the opposite direction to permit the aircraft to intercept and proceed along the reciprocal of the designated track.

### Base Turn (teardrop)

base turn consists of a specified outbound track and timing or DME distance from the facility, followed ny a turn to intercept the inbound track where the tracks are not reciprocal.

a turn executed by the aircraft during the initial approach between the end of the outbound track and the beginning of the intermediate or final approach track.   
Tracks are not reciprocal.

### racetrack procedures

racetrack is a procedure designed to enable the aircraft to reduce altitude during the intial approach segment and/or establish the aircraft inbound when the entry into a reversal procedure is not practical.   
It consists of a turn from the inbound track through 180deg from overhead the facility of fix on the outbound track for 1,2, or 3 minutes, followed by a 180deg turn in the same direction to return to the inbound track.   
The outbound leg may be limited by DME range instead of timing.   

A shuttle is a climb or descent conducted in a holding pattern.


### intermediate approach segment

segment during which the aircraft speed and configuration should be adjusted to prrepare the aircraft for final approach.   
Descent gradient as shallow as possible.  
During the intermediate approah the obstacle clearance requirement reduces from 300m (984ft) to 150m (492ft) in the primary area.

When a final approach fix is available, the intermediate approach segment begins when the aircraft is on the inbound track of the procedure turn, base turn, or final inbound leg of the racetrack procedure.

Where no final approach fix is specified, the inbound track is the final approach segment.

in case of an operational advantage, an ILS procedure may include a dead reckoning segment from a fix to the localiser.  
The DR track will intersect the localiser at 45deg and not be more than 19km/10NM in length. The point of intersection is the beginning of the intermediate segment and will allow for proper glide path interception.

Speed control -- during the intermediate and final phases of the approach, a radar controller may request an aircraft to make adjustments of up to 20kts.    
Speed controll should not be applied within 4NM of the threshold on final approach.

### final approach segment

segment for alignment and descent for landing.   
final approach may  be made to a runway for a straight in landing or to an aerodrome for a visual maneuver.   

for straight-in approaches, the angle formed by the final approach track and the runway centre line must not exceed    
* 30deg for procedures restricted to CAT A and B aircraft
* 15deg for other categories.

A stepdown fix may be incorporated in non-precision approach procedures in which case two OCA/H values will be published:     
* higher value applied to the primary procedure, and 
* lower value applicable only if the stepdown fix is positively identified during the approach.

final approach segment begins at the final approach point FAP or the final approach fix FAF, and ends at the missed approach point MAPt.

### Final Approach Fix and Final Approach Point

final approach segment begins at FAF - if there is one.    
The FAF should not be more than 10NM from landing surface.   

For ILS/MLS approaches, the final approach segment begins at the final approach point FAP.   
The segment ends at the missed approach point MAPt.

FAP is a point in space on the centre line of the localiser or the MLS azimut specified for the final approach track where the intermediate approach alt/height intersects the nominal glide path or MLS elevation angle.   
The FAP normally occurs at heights between 300m (984ft) and 900m (2955ft) above the runway elevation.

### Approach Area Splays

accuracy of facilities for tracking information ~ widen or narrowing instrument approach areas

area width VOR 2.0NM and 2.5NM for NDB    
area splays at 7.8deg for VOR and 10.3deg for NDB   
optimum and maixum distances for the FAF are 5NM and 10NM

descent angle    
optimum descent gradient is 5.2%/3deg    
minimum descent gradient is 4.3%/2.5deg    
maximum descent gradient     
- CAT A/B: 6.5%/3.7deg    
- CAT B/D/E: 6.1%/3.5deg    
- CAT H (heli): 10%/5.7deg

precision approaches the preferred glide angle is 3deg    
higher values are only used where there is no other way to avoid obstacles.    
The glide angle for ILS CAT II or III must be 3deg

### Non-precision approaches - vertical flight path

studies: high risk of CFIT for non-precision approaches --> training and standardisation

ICAO: 3 methods
* constant angle descent
* step-down descent
* continuous descent final approach

* constant angle descent    
approach flown at constant angle from FAF or equivalent to a reference datutm (typically) 50ft above the runway threshold.    
at MDA/H: if the required visual reference are not given, level off at or above MDA/H until visual or MAPt at which go-around is initiated

* step-down descent    
approach flown in a series of steps immediately descending to the next stepdown altitude or height to MDA/H.    
Higher than normal descent rates require careful height monitoring.

* continuous descent final approach     
CDFA requires a continuous descent from altitude, or at least from the initial approach fix (IAF) to a point 50ft above the threshold.    
The descent to pass any stepdown fix at or above the minimum altitude.    
Unlike constant angle, the aircraft is not flown level at or near to MDH, the visual references are either adequate in which case the approach is continued or not. If not: go-around.    

to avoid descent below MDA/H, the go-around must be initiated slightly above MDA/H.    
Operators may specify additional increments (typically 50ft) to be added to MDA/H.    

If go-around is initiated at or near MDH, no lateral or turning part of the missed approach procedure can be started until the MAPt is passed.

The CDFA is preferred by ICAO. Many states require the use of this technique and apply increased visibility or RVR requirements when on e of the alternative techniques is used.

During a non-precision approach such as a NDB-only approach, a QFE altimeter setting shall be provided to the aircraft on request or on a regular basis in accordance with local procedures. It shall be the QFE for the aerodrome elevation EXCEPT for non-precision approach runways, if the threshold is 2m (7m) or more below the aerodrome elevation in which cases the QFE for the relevant runway threshold 

### Surveillance Radar Approach

A surveillance radar approach SRA will normally stop 2NM before the threshold.   
With approval of appropriate authority and if accuracy of the radar permits, it may continue to the runway threshold.    
Under these circumstances the controller will pass distance and level information every half mile.


### ILS Approaches

ILS approach begins at the final approach point ==> glidepath interception occurs at heights between 300m (984ft) and 900m (2955ft) above runway elevation.

Obstacle clearance surfaces for an ILS approach assumes a pilot localiser accuracy of half a scale defelection and glide path accurace of half course fly-up deflection after being established on thrack.

ILS/MLS glidepath failure    
If the ILS glidepath or MLS elevation angle are lost, the procedure reverts to a non-precision approach.   
Separate procedures will be published to cater for this, often on the same approach plate/chart, with appropriate revised OCA/OCH.

### Visual Maneuvering (Circling) Approach

Visual Maneuvering (Circling) is the term used to describe the visual phase of flight after completing an instrument approach to position the aircraft for landing on a runway which is not suitable for a straight-in approach.

The visual maneuvering area is determined by arcs centered on each runway threshold and joining those arcs with tangents.   
The radius of the arcs is related to the aircraft category, and therefore the speed.

In case of prominent obstacle in the visual maneuvering area, but outside the final approach and missed approach area, the published procedure may prohibit circling in this sector.    
No 'single' circling approach procedure can be designed as every aerodrome has its own particular characteristics regarding obstacle location.

After establishment of visual maneuvering area, the OCA/OCH for each aircraft category is determined.   
As in non-precision approaches a margin may be added to the OCA/OCH to allow for operational considerations so that the MDA/MDH can never be lower than the OCA/OCH and is often higher.

After initial visual contact, the assumption is that the runway environment (i.e., runway threshold or approach lighting aids or other markings identifiable with the runway) should be kept in sight while circlung at MDA/MDH.

Descent below MDA/H    
* visual reference established and can be maintained
* pilot has landing threhold in sight; and
* required obstacle clearance can be maintained and the aircraft is in a position to carry out a landing

Loss of visual reference    
If visual reference is lost while circling to land from an instrument approach, the missed approach procedure specified for that particular procedure must be followed.   

It is expected that the aircrew will make an initial climbing turn toward the landing runway and overhead the aerodrome where the crew will establish the aircraft climbing on the missed approach track.

In as much as the circling maneuver may be accomplisehed in more than one direction, different patterns will be required to establish the aircraft on the prescribed missed approach course depending on its position at the time the visual reference is lost.

Missed approach on a circling approach is to make an initial climbing turn toward the landing runway and then - when overhead - establish the aircraft on the missed approach track.

### Missed Approach

During the missed approach phase --> high workload: aircraft configuration, attitude and altitude ==> design of missed approach as simple as possble ... in 3 phases:    

* initial phase: starts at missed approach point and ends where climb is established
* intermediate phase: starts where climb is established and extends to the point where 50m (164ft) obstacle clearance is obtained an can be maintained
* final phase: begins at point where 50m (164ft) obstacle clearance is first obtained and extends to the point where a new approach, holding, or return to enroute flight is initiated.

Typically, procedures are based on a minimum missed approach gradent of 2.5% (nominal gradient).    
Gradient of 2% may be used, if necessary survey and safeguarding have been provided.     
With approval by appropriate authority, gradients of 3,4, or 5% may be used for aircraft whose climb performance permits an operational advantage to be obtained.   

If a gradient different than the "nominal" gradient of 2.5% is used, it will be indicated on the instrument approach chart.    
In addition, the OCA/H applicable to the nominal gradient will be shown.

A missed approach point is specified for EACH instrument approah perocedure where the missed approach begins and a point of an altitude/height where it ends.

Missed approach is (assumed) to be initiated not lower than D/H IN PRECISION approach procedures, or at a specified point in non-preciion approach procedures not laower than the MDA/H.

The missed approach point MAPt in a procedure may be:    
* the point of intersection of an electronic glide path with the applicable DA/H;
* a navigation facility;
* a fix; or
* a specified distance from the final approach fix FAF

Nominal missed approach procedure climb gradient is 2.5%.    
The missed approach procedure assumes that the missed approach starts no lawer than the DA/H or MDA/H.

If upon reaching MAPt, the required visual reference is not established, the procedure requires that a missed approach be initiated at once for protection from obstacles.    
It is assumed that the pilot will fly the published missed approach procedure.    
If the missed approach is initiated PRIOR to arriving at the missed approach point, it is expected that the pilot will normally proceed to the missed approach point and then follow the missed approach procedure in order to remain within the protected airspace.    
MAPt can be flown to and crossed at higher altitudes than required for the procedure.    
The MAPt is defined a flyover waypoint in the FMS.

From the earliest MAPt, the area splays at 15deg on each side of the missed approach track , at least until the start of climb SOC is reached.   
This is based on some RNAV limitations and pilot's workload at the beginning of the missed approach phase.

The missed approach procedure must be initiated if the required visual references are not obtained by the time the aircraft reaches the MAPt.


An aircraft on surveillance radar approach SRA or precision approach radar PAR under radar control should be directed to execute a missed approach procedure:    

* if the aircraft appears to be dangerously positioned,
* for traffic deconfliction;
* if clearance to land has not been received by the time the aircraft reaches 2NM from touchdown; or
* on instruction from the aerodrome controller

An aircraft making a radar approach should be advised to consider exectuting a missed approach procedure, if     
* aircraft reaches a position from which it appears that a successful approach cannot be completed;
* the aircraft is not visible on the radar display for a significant interval during the last 2NM of the approach;
* clearance to land has not been received from the non-radar controller by the time the aircraft has reached 2NM from touchdown.

ATC will direct a missed approach procedure,if clearance to land is not received by 2 NM.

### Performance Based Navigation PBN

PBN is based on area navigation systems RNAV.    
PBN aims at global standardisation of RNAV and RNP specifications and to limit the proliferation of navigation specifications world-wide.

airborne performance requirements are expressed in Navigation Specifications in terms of accuracy, integrity, continuity, and functionality needed for the proposed operation in the context of a particual airspace concept.   
Within the airspace concepts, the availability of NGSS signal-in-space SIS or that os some other applicable navigation infrastratuture has to be considered in order to enable the navigation application.

PBN is then described through means of RNAV and RNP applications with respective RNAV and RNP operations.

3 components:    
* navigation specification,
* navaid infrastructure, and
* navigation application.

Navigation specification prescribes the performance requirements in terms of accuracy, integrity, continueity for proposed operations in a particular airspace. The Navigation Specification also describes how these performance requirements are to be acheieved, i.e., which navigation functionalities are required to achieve the prescribed performance.     
Associated with the Navigation Specification are requirements related to pilot knowledge and traineing, and operational approval.    a
Navigation Spacification is either an RNP specification or an RNAV specification.    
A RNP specification includes a requirement for on-board self-obtained performance monitoring and alerting while a RNAV specification does not.

The Navaid Infrastructure relates to ground- or space-based navigation aides that are referenced in each navigation specification. The availability of the navaid infrastructure has to be considered in order to enable the navigagtion application.

The navigation application refers to the application of the navigation specification and navaid infrastructure in the contaext of an airspace concept to ATS routes and instrument flight procedures.

PBN. States to prescribe navigation specification.   
When applicable the navigation specification(s) for designated areas, tracks or ATS routes shall be described on the basis of regional air navigation agreements.    
In designating a navigation specification, limitations may apply as a result of navigation infrastructure constrints or specific navigation functionality requirements.     
THe prescribed navigation specification shall be appropriate to the level of communication, navigation, and air traffic services provided in the airspace concerned.

Development from conventional routes to RNP routes:

* conventional routes: today's airways connect ground-based navigation aides, limited design flexibility      
* RNAV: area navigation RNAV routes follow defined "waypoints" ~ increased airspace efficiency     
* RNP required navigation Performance routes within specified containment area ~ optimise use of airspace (curved paths)

specificed navigation accuracy for a route or departure/approach procedure is given in NM units:    
* enroute RNP: 2 NM or greater
* approach RNP: as low as 0.11NM

Precision approach and landing systems such as the ILS, MLS and NGSS GLS for part of the navigation suite, but are not incldued within the concept of performance-based navigation.     
They differ from PBN applications in that they ar enot based on area navigation techniques.

## Holding Procedures

Holding - conceptually "anywhere"

### Obstacle Clearane in the Hold

holding --> holding area at a given level or altitude.
The holding will be defined by a faciltiy, e.g. VOR/DME, or a fix.

Holding Area is a volume of airspace made up of the basic holding area and the entry area.

**basic holding area** at any particular level is the airspace required at tht level to encompass a racetrack holding pattern based on the allowance for aircraft speed, wind effect, timing errors, hodling fix characertistics, etc.

**entry area** incldes the airspace required to accommodate the specified entry procedures.

For the determination of the minimum holding level, a buffer area of 5NM beyond the boundary of the holding area is applied.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/airlaw-holding-area.png")
```

minimum holding level provides a clearance of at least:     
* 300m (984ft) above obstacles in the holding area    
* a reducing value which provides clearance above obstacles in the buffer area

published minimum holding altitude i rounded UP to the nearest 50m or 100ft as appropriate.

The lowest flight level available for use above the transition altitude is called transition level.   
Over high terreain or in mountanous areas, obstacle clearance up to a total of 600m/1969ft is provided to allow for the possible effects of turbulence, down drafts, and other meteorologicagl phenomena on altimeter performance.

### Holding Procedure

Holding and entry procedures are described in ENR section of AIP.

In case a pilot cannot conform with holding procedures for any holding patterns, air traffic control shall be advised asap.

ICAO: RIGHT TURN holding pattern.     
For left-turn holding pattern, the corresponding entry and holding procedures are mirrored about the inbound holding track.

If no operational procedures prevail, authorities should design right turn holding patterns!

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/airlaw-holding-pattern-from-station.png")
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/airlaw-holding-pattern-to-station.png")
```

General rules:    

* all turn at bank angle of 25deg or at rate of 3deg per second, which ever requires the lesser bank
* procedures depict tracks and pilots should attempt to maintain the track by making allowance for known wind by applying correnction both to the heading and timing during entry and while flying in the holding pattern
* oubound timing begins over or abeam the fix whichever occurs later. If the abeam position cannot be determined, start timing when the turn the the outbound leg is completed
* if outbound leg length is based on a DME distance, the ouboutnd leve terminates as soon as the limiting DME deistance is attained
* for shape and terminology c.f. figures.

### Entering the holding

3 possible procedures to enter the hold, depending on the aircraft's inbound heading:     
* **parallel entry** = sector 1 entry
* **offset entry** = sector two entry
* **direct entry** = sector three entry

"zone of flexibility" either side of the sector boundaries, if the entry heading is whing 5deg of the boundary either procedure may be chosen.

Turns at the end of the oubound entry leg my be specified in terms of DME, otherwise turns should be made on time.    
This is one minute, if below or at 14 000ft, and one and a half minute if above 14000ft.    
In this context 140000ft must be interpreted as being according to the cleared altitude of level. I.e., if you are on QNH := 14 000ft, if on 1013.25hpa := FL 140

**parallel entry** aircruft turned left onto an outbound heading to achieve the reciprocal of the inbound track. at appropriate time or distance, turn left to intercept the ibound track of return directory to the fix.     
As the fix is passed for the 2nd time, right turn to enter holding pattern.

**offset entry (teardrop entry)**  at the fix the aircraft is turned left of right to make good track 30deg left of the reciprocal of the inbound track.    
At appropriate time of distane the aircraft is turned right to make good the inbound track to the fix.     
As the fix is passed a 2nd time, right turn to enter holding pattern.

**direct entry** when reaching fix, the aircraft is turned right to enter holding pattern.


example: right turn holding, 1 min outbound, inbound magnetic track 052.    
aircraft approaching with no wind on magnetic track 232.

inbound track: 052 ==> outbound track: 052 + 180 = 232 (== approach track)   
==> 5deg flexibility ~ either parallel or offset (teardrop) entry.


Flying the holding procedure - aircraft passing fix is enterin holding = right turn to outbound leg.     
Outbound leg continued to appropriate time of DME distance. If time, 1 min or 90secs depending on altitude/flight level.   
Right turn to regain inbound track before holding fix is passed.

Pilots to make adjustments to heading and timing to ensure regaining of inbound track before passing holding fix.   
If end of outbound is defined by DME distance, timing cannot be adjusted.

Holding Speeds

|-------------------|------------------------|
|level              | normal                 |
|-------------------|------------------------|
|up to FL140        | CAT A & B: 170kt       |
|                   | CAT C & D: 230kt       |
|-------------------|------------------------|
|above FL140 - FL200|    240kt               |
|-------------------|------------------------|
|above FL200-FL340  | 265kt                  |
|-------------------|------------------------|
|above FL340        | M0.83                  |
|-------------------|------------------------|

Departing/leaving the hold at set time    
When clearance is received that specifies the time of depature form the holding point, the pilot should adjust the pattern within the limits of the established holding procedure in order to leave the holding point at the time specified.

## Altimeter Setting Procedures

Standardised altimeter setting --> vertical separation between aircraft and adequate terrain (obstacle) clearance during all phases of flight.

Below or at **transition altitude**, aircraft is flown at altitudes based on altimeter setting to MSL, i.e., QNH. Vertical position = altitude.

Above **transition altitude**, aircraft flown on standard constant atmospheric pressure of 1013.25hPa ~ flight levels FL.

Where no transition altitude has been established for the area (e.g. remote areas), aircraft in the enroute phase must be flown at flight levels FL (standard pressure setting of 1013.25hPa)

Altimeter settings provided to aircraft shall be rounded DOWN to nearest whole hectopascal.

### Transition Altitude & Transition Level

Transition altitude is the altitude below which the vertical position of the aircraft is controlled by altitudes above mean sea level MSL.

TA must be specified for each aerodrome by the State in which the aerodrome is located.    
In practice, and to avoid confusion, transition altitudes are normally standardised for the whole FIR.

Whereas the transition altitude is fixed, the **transition level** changes based on QNH/air pressure. ATC to determine the transition level.    
- calculated height of the transition altitude is rounded up to the next full 1000ft (e.g. 3300ft --> 4000ft).

Transition altitudes "as low as possible", but normally not less than 3000ft.

Nearby aerodromes - coordination for common transition altitude = highest transition altitude if considered separately.

Transition altitudes are published in AIP and shown on approach charts.

**transition level** change in reference from altitude on QNH to flight levels (standard pressure).

Transition level = lowest flight level available for use above the transition altitude.

An aircraft in descent must set QNH at the transition level.

Transition altitude = altitude at which the pilot in a climb changes from QNH to 1013.2/standard pressure.    
Transition level = lowest flight level available for use above the tranistion altitude.    
Transition level is the flight level at which the pilot in a desent changes altimeter setting from standard/1013.2 to QNH.

### Transition Layer

transition layer := layer between transition altitude and transition level.

transition altitude < transition layer < transition level 

within transition layer: vertical position should be expressed in terms of flight levels when ascending and in terms of altitude when descendeing.

variations exists.

### Pre-flight Operational Test

**QNH setting** - aircraft at known elevation on the aerodrome, set altimeter pressure scale to current QNH seting. Vibrate instrument by tapping unless mechanical vibration is provided ~~ -/+80ft for a 0-50.000ft altimeter

**QFE setting** - aircraft at known elevation on the aerodrome, set altimeter pressure scale to the current QFE. Vibrate insturment unless mechanical vibration is provided ~~ -/+ 80ft for 0-50.000ft altimeter.

-/+60ft for altimeter 0-30.000ft range.


### Take-off and Climb

QNH must be made available to aircraft as part of the taxi-clearance.    
Prior to take-off at least one altimeter must be set to the latest QNH altimeter setting for the aerodrome.

### Approach

During the approach to land terrain clearance may be detmined by using QNH (giving altitude) or - under specified circumstances - a QFE setting (gibving height above the QFE datum).


## Parallel Runway Operations

Near parallel runways are defined as non-intersecting runways whose extended center lines diverge or converge by 15 degrees or less.    
Rules apply equally to exactly paralle or near parallel runways.

### Parallel Approaches

**independent parallel approaches** = approaches which are made to parallel runway where radar separation minima between aircraft using adjacent ILS are not prescribed.

**dependent parallel approaches** = approaches which are made to parallel runways where radar separation minima between aircraft using adjacent ILS and/are prescribed.

### Parallel Departures

simultaneous departure for aircraft departing in the same direcetion from parallel runways.

### both parallel approaches and departures

3 sets of operations that allow both approaches and departures from parallel runways:     
- mixed    
- segregated     
- semi-mixed

**mixed operations** = simultaneous parallel approaches with departures interspersed on both runways      
**segregated operations** = exclusive use of one runway for approaches and the other for departures     
**semi-mixed operations** = either one runway used exclusively for departures, while the other ruenway accepts a mixture of approaches and depattures, or one runway is exclusively used for approaches and the other accepts a mix of departures and approaches.


### Simultaneous Independent Approach Procedures

simultaneous independent parallel approaches are in progress

* controller will issue instructions to ensure separation between aircraft and prevent aircraft from entering the NTZ;
* arriving aircraft will be vetored to one of the other of the parallel ILS localiser courses;
* when cleared for an ILS approach, a procedure turn is not permitted;
* the final vector must allow at least 1NM of straight and level flight before the localiser final approach track interception.
* the final vector must also enable the aircraft to be established on the ILS localiser course final approach track in level flight for at least 2NM prior to intercepting the ILS glidepath;
* each pari of parallel approaches will have a *high side* and a *low side* for vectoring to privde vertical eparation until aircraft are established inbound on their respective parallel ILS localiser course and/final approach track. The main objective is that both aircraft to be estabished on the ILS localiser course final approach track befor ethe 300m/1000ft vertical separation is reduced;
* if considered necessary, appropriate missed apporahc instructions will be issued.

Aircraft must be vectored ot be established on the localiser at least 2NM before the glide path interception.

## questions

* RSA/RESA = runway safety area (RSA) or runway end safety area (RESA): = he surface surrounding the runway prepared or suitable for reducing the risk of damage to airplanes in the event of an undershoot, [1] overshoot, or excursion from the runway

* Initial Approach Fix marks beginning of instrument approach = transition from "arrival" to "instrument approach" = end of standard arrival procedure, i.e., STAR permits transition from enroute phase to approach phase
