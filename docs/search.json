QNH is determined by measuring QFE and increasing it to sea level assuming ISA temparature values for the calculation.\n\nairfield QNH is measured AMSL for the position of the aerodrome. It must be set at least on one altimeter when departing fom an aerodrome in controlled airspace.\nin some States, a Regional or Zone QNH is available. This is the lowest QNH for the next hour within the Altimeter Setting Region (ASR) or Zone Area.\n\n\nThe air mass is not exactly ISA when Altimeter reads zero with QNH ~ you are not exactly at sea level.\nIn cold air you will be above MSL. In warm air you will be below it.\nThe QNH and actual sea level pressure (QFF) will only be the same if the ambient conditions are - in fact - ISA.\nThe standard QNH is 1013.25 hPa or 29.92 in (inches of mercury).\nThis setting makes the altimeter read a pressure altitude of Flight Level.\nThis setting is used for traffic above the “transition level”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExam questions is about working out difference between levels.

    "text": "5.6 Vertical Speed Indicator VSI\nVSI records the rate of change of static pressure, and displays it as a rate of climb/descent.\nInstrument consists of capsule fed with static pressure. The case is also fed with static pressure.\nStatic feed to case is passed through a very small gap, the metering unit.\nIf the aircraft changes its altitude, the capsule reacts immediately whilst the pressure change in the case is slower.\nThe differential pressure is maintained as long as the aircraft continues to climb or descend. But once level, the pressure equalises and the rate of climb or descend returns to zero.\nKey component: metering unit. Metering unit uses a “choke” directing the air through both a capillary tube and a “knife edge orifice”.\ninstantaneous VSis simple VSI will not show rate of climb or descent immediately. There is time lag in indication while pressure difference between capsule and case builds up.\nThe IVSI counters this by including in the static line two weights in dashpots central with springs … causing immediate differenial pressure because of the inertia as aircraft enters climb/descend.\nDashpots are sometimes called “accelerometers”.\nSteep turns: IVSI will initially show a climb - stabilise - descent on rollout.\nDo not trust IVSI when turns &gt; 40 degrees or changing load factor in turn.\nOther systems for vertical speed\n\nmodern strap-down inertial reference system IRS - vertical acceleration and velocity are available from IRS as one of the accelerometers calculates movement in vertical axis.\nbarometric height in electronic form from ADC, the rate of change of height can be calculated and displayed as vertical velocity.\ndynamic vane VSI - difference between static and metered static pressure induces a flow over moveable vanes, rather like a small air turbine instead of using a capsule. Movement of the vances records the vertical speek.\n\nIn practice, modern transport aircraft will use one of the two electronic systems driven by ADC or IRS\n\n5.6.1 Errors and blockage\ninstrument error - can be present. Can be largely compensated for with an adjusting screw that zeroes the reading.\nlag - the basic VSI design sees a lag before a rate of climb or descent is indicated. This may take sometimes up to several seconds. IVSI overcomes this. Modern inertial systems do not suffer from this error.\nstatic errors - error in the absolute value of static pressure produces NO error. However, a change in static pressure when none is due will give a false indicator of climb or descent.\nThe pressure driven instrument is susceptible to maneuver errors, particularly during take-off and go-around, and in turbulence.\nstatic blockage will cause the pressure driven instruments read zero in all circumstances.\nstatic leak to the pressure cabin will ause the instrument to read cabin rate of climb and descent.\nOn start-up, all VSIs should read zero.\ncool explanation: flight-club: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZBzs2b2kJU https://flight-club.com.au/\npUd pOc sOd sUc\nsOd - is static is blocked in descent, the airspeed indicator will Overread\nPUDSUC POCSOD\npUd == pitot blocked in descent - ASI under-reads SUC == stqtic blocked in Climb - ASI under-reads",

    "text": "5.10 Magnetism - Compass Reading\nhttps://www.studyaircrafts.com/compass-system\nA compass is an instrument designed to indicate direction on the surface of the earth, relative to some known datum. The magnetic compass works on the principle that a freely suspended magnet will align itself with the earth’s magnetic field such that one end will point toward the north magnetic pole.\nThe purpose of a magnetic ‘steering’ compass in an aircraft is to indicate heading, the direction in which the aircraft is pointing. Magnetic influences - iron/steel components, electric currents - distort the earth’s field so that the compass magnet assembly deviates from the magnetic meridian. This is called compass deviation.\nIt is mandatory that all civil aircraft must carry such a compass and in all but light general aviation aircraft it serves as a standby compass.​\n\n5.10.1 Deviation\nAircraft manufacturing –&gt; magnetisation; aircraft degaussing.\nResidual magnetism which can influence compass readings.\nOther sources: cargo\nDistortion of Earth’s magnetic field, or electrical fields (e.g. aircraft equipment)\n\n\n5.10.2 Factors affecting Deviation\nDeviation experienced by an aircraft is specific to each aircraft and varies with heading and magnetic latitude.\nVariation with heading occurs as resultant aircraft fields oppose Earth’s field, both + or -. On which headings this happens is dependent on how deviating fields are aligned with aircraft.\nVariation with magnetic latitude is due to horizontal component of Earth’s magnetic field H. It varies in strength depending on where it is detected. At the magnetic equator all the field is in H component, at the poles, the H component is weak to non-existing.\nIf H is weak, the deviating forces are proportionally stronger. Thus, deviation is greater near the poles and smaller at magnetic equator.\n\n\n5.10.3 Magnetic Direction\nVariation is the difference between true and magnetic direction/headings.\nVariation east - magnetic least.\nVariation west - magnetic best.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"./figures/inst-magnetic-variation.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.10.4 Compass Direction\nInfluence by Earth’s magnetic field.

    "section": "7.3 Digital Computers / Circuits",
    "text": "7.3 Digital Computers / Circuits\ncomputers are pervasive.\nA computer can be very simply defined as a machine for manipulating data according to a list of instructions.\nDigital computers use semiconductors in integrated circuits to store and process information in binary form.\nData in –&gt; input peripherals –&gt; computer –&gt; output peripherals –&gt; data out\n\n7.3.1 von Neumann Model\nA computer has 6 basic features and capabilities. The von Neumann model calls for\n\ninput and output facilities\nprocessing unit\nmemory\nprogrammes and data sharing the same memory\nprogramme steps carried out in a sequential manner (software programme)\nprocessor and memory joined as a pair\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Central Processing Unit CPU\nComputers have one or more CPUs.\nCPU to execture the programmes stored in the memory by fetching the instructions, examining then, and then executing them in a sequential manner.\nCPU task can be described as: fetch-decode-execute cycle.\nCPU has 3 components\n\ncontrol unit - responsible for fetchnig instructions from memory and determining their type\narithmetic and locig unit (ALU) - performing the arithmetical and logical operations\n(small high speed) memory - to store temporary results and control information. The memory is made up of registers, often only 32 bits big.\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Memory\nmemory = to store programmes and data while the computer is operating, and - in some cases - when the computer is turned off.\nIf information does disappear when the power is off: volatile memory.\nTwo main types of memory are: RAM and ROM.\nMost common form: Random Access Memory (RAM) ~ read/write memory.\nData in RAM can be changed easily while the computer is operating.\nsemiconductor RAM can be devided in 2 sub-categories:\n\nstatic RAM, and\ndynamic RAM (DRAM).\n\nStatic RAM will hold information without being refreshed as long as the power is on.\nDynamic RAM needs refreshing every few milliseconds. DRAM ‘simplicity’ ~ allows four times the density of static RAM, but is slower to use than static RAM.\nROM - read-only memory; data stored in a chip that cannot be erased intentionally or otherwise. Used for start-up programmes and standard mathematical routines.\nPROM - programmable read-only memory; can be programmed once into a “blank” chip making manufacture easier.\nEPROM - erasable programmable read only memory; chips to be re-used after a (lengthy) erasing process.\n\n\n7.3.4 input and output interfaces\ninput interface = convert input data from a format that humans can use to something the computer can use.\nexample: CDU keyboard of a FMC –&gt; information going in is analogue, and it must be converted to digital data for the computer. This involves an analogue / digital conversion at the input interface.\nOutput interface use (often) a digital/analogue conversion to change computer data into human readable data. A CDU dispaly screen on a FMC converts digital into graphical information.\n\n\n7.3.5 software\n….. binary 0-1\n64-bit binary\ndecimal system: the greater the number of digits available, the greate ther range of numbers we can display\n==&gt; 4 digits available –&gt; 10.000 numbers, i.e., from 0000 to 9999\nbinary equivalent to 9999 uses 14 digits\n==&gt; 64-bit computer uses binary code with 64 digits\n==&gt; each instruction could be one of (2^64 - 1) possibilities.\nhexadecimal\n==&gt; more compact form; hexadecimal uses based 16 (16 possibilities for each bit)\nmachine code\ncomputer languages can be written in humanfriendly format - then converted into hexadecimal or binary machine code.\nrule of machine code are particular to every CPU and dependent on CPU architecture.\nThus, machine-code written for on CPU not ‘portable’ to another type of CPU.\nassembly - conversion computer programme to machine code\nassembler - utility software used to carry out the assembly process.\nassembly languages\nlow-level vs high-level languages\nhigh-level languages: Java, C++, or C#\nprogrammers will (still) use assembly languages when dealing with mission-critical systems often running on embedded devices.\nexample: automatic braking system, flight control systems.\n\nprogramming in assembly language is generally regarded as a more robust way to create software for embedded devices.\n\nhigh-level languages offer alternative\n\n\nThus, assembly language\n\nis used to programme mission-critical software\nis more user-friendly than machine code\nis a low level language; and\nfiles must be abstracted into machine code to be used by computers.\n\nabstraction ~ degree to which a (computer) language uses easily understood phrases.\nA language may use a term to describe a process, but the way that process is implemented by the computer is hidden from the programmer.\nlow-level: to display something on the screen: programmer needs to specify what to display and how the item should look (colours, fonts, …)\nhigh-level: it is not necessary to specify how to go about displaying somethig on a screen.\nThe amount of abstraction defines how “high-level” a programming language is.\nreminder: assembly = low-level language.\nfiles produced in high-level languages must be converted before they can be used by a computer. This process is called ‘compiling’.\na.) 2 steps: high-level language –&gt; assembly language –&gt; abstracted in machine code b.) 1 step: directly compiled to machine code.\n scripting languages\nscripting languages do not undergo similar conversion to produce a file wihch can run on a computer.\nScripts are sets of instructions which are interrogated by other software.\nE.g. website pages with embedded scripts (possibly Javascript) – the browser interrogates the webpage that contains the script(s).\nTwo way communication between browser and script:\nscript give instructions to browser or data based in the information passed to the script by the browser.\nE.g. webpage recognising country you are in.\nASP, Javascript, Perl, Python\n\n\n\n7.3.6 Connections\nComputers on an aircraft would be useless, if they were unable to communicate with each other.\nThe approach used is to connect them using ‘computer buses’.\nLatin ‘omnibus’ meaning ‘all together’.\nComputer buses may be\n\nserial - where the data is sent in packages one after the other; or\nparallel - where multiple data paths exists, allowing flow in both directions.\n\nEarly systems used ‘daisy chaining’ = data passed through each part of the system to reach its destination.\nExample of a data bus on a modern aircraft is the controller aera network CANBUS.\nOriginally from automobile industry, adopted by Airbus for the A380.\nCANBUS connects all of the electronic control units involved in a group of functions by serial connections.\n\nsoftware certification.\nOperating systems are termed ‘multi-tasking’ as they allow more than one programme to run at the same time. –&gt; actually sequentially = software solution\nNot to be confused with ‘multi-processing’ ~ more than one processor (2 or more CPUs) are used to operate a single computer programme. = hardware solution\nMulti-processing is the case for most airborne systems (some multi-tasking) ~ safety back.\nDiffernt parts of the aircraft may use variations of operating systems.\nThe FMS is a much bigger type of OS than - for example - the ATSU which has far fewer functions to handle.\nSimple systems, e.g. Air Data Computer ADC, only has to execute a relatively simple mathematical functions such as deriving SAT from TAT.\nFlight safety regarding computer software and electronic documentation on aircrafr is certified under EROCAE standards.\nED-12B “Software Considerations in AIrborne Systems and Equipment Certification” details requirements for software planning development and safety.\nNote: software is never certified as standalone entity. Respective hardware is also considered.\nThe idea of system safety is crucial to how the regulation within E12B used to certify airborne equirments.\n5 levels oare defined\nfailure software catastrophic A hazardous B major C minor D no-effect E\nan aircraft with fly-by-wire flight controls is computer controlled. failur of the software would be catastropic. Software level ‘A’ is defined as meaning that failure woud result in the loss of ability to continue safe flight and landing.\nFailure at level C, C, D would increase crew workload and reduce operational taksinging of the aircraft - but would not prevent safe flight.\ne.g. failure of FMC.\nFailure of level E software would have no effect on operations or pilot workload.\ne.g. in-flight entertainment equipment.",
