QNH is determined by measuring QFE and increasing it to sea level assuming ISA temparature values for the calculation.\n\nairfield QNH is measured AMSL for the position of the aerodrome. It must be set at least on one altimeter when departing fom an aerodrome in controlled airspace.\nin some States, a Regional or Zone QNH is available. This is the lowest QNH for the next hour within the Altimeter Setting Region (ASR) or Zone Area.\n\n\nThe air mass is not exactly ISA when Altimeter reads zero with QNH ~ you are not exactly at sea level.\nIn cold air you will be above MSL. In warm air you will be below it.\nThe QNH and actual sea level pressure (QFF) will only be the same if the ambient conditions are - in fact - ISA.\nThe standard QNH is 1013.25 hPa or 29.92 in (inches of mercury).\nThis setting makes the altimeter read a pressure altitude of Flight Level.\nThis setting is used for traffic above the “transition level”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExam questions is about working out difference between levels.

    "text": "5.6 Vertical Speed Indicator VSI\nVSI records the rate of change of static pressure, and displays it as a rate of climb/descent.\nInstrument consists of capsule fed with static pressure. The case is also fed with static pressure.\nStatic feed to case is passed through a very small gap, the metering unit.\nIf the aircraft changes its altitude, the capsule reacts immediately whilst the pressure change in the case is slower.\nThe differential pressure is maintained as long as the aircraft continues to climb or descend. But once level, the pressure equalises and the rate of climb or descend returns to zero.\nKey component: metering unit. Metering unit uses a “choke” directing the air through both a capillary tube and a “knife edge orifice”.\ninstantaneous VSis simple VSI will not show rate of climb or descent immediately. There is time lag in indication while pressure difference between capsule and case builds up.\nThe IVSI counters this by including in the static line two weights in dashpots central with springs … causing immediate differenial pressure because of the inertia as aircraft enters climb/descend.\nDashpots are sometimes called “accelerometers”.\nSteep turns: IVSI will initially show a climb - stabilise - descent on rollout.\nDo not trust IVSI when turns &gt; 40 degrees or changing load factor in turn.\nOther systems for vertical speed\n\nmodern strap-down inertial reference system IRS - vertical acceleration and velocity are available from IRS as one of the accelerometers calculates movement in vertical axis.\nbarometric height in electronic form from ADC, the rate of change of height can be calculated and displayed as vertical velocity.\ndynamic vane VSI - difference between static and metered static pressure induces a flow over moveable vanes, rather like a small air turbine instead of using a capsule. Movement of the vances records the vertical speek.\n\nIn practice, modern transport aircraft will use one of the two electronic systems driven by ADC or IRS\n\n5.6.1 Errors and blockage\ninstrument error - can be present. Can be largely compensated for with an adjusting screw that zeroes the reading.\nlag - the basic VSI design sees a lag before a rate of climb or descent is indicated. This may take sometimes up to several seconds. IVSI overcomes this. Modern inertial systems do not suffer from this error.\nstatic errors - error in the absolute value of static pressure produces NO error. However, a change in static pressure when none is due will give a false indicator of climb or descent.\nThe pressure driven instrument is susceptible to maneuver errors, particularly during take-off and go-around, and in turbulence.\nstatic blockage will cause the pressure driven instruments read zero in all circumstances.\nstatic leak to the pressure cabin will ause the instrument to read cabin rate of climb and descent.\nOn start-up, all VSIs should read zero.\ncool explanation: flight-club: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZBzs2b2kJU https://flight-club.com.au/\npUd pOc sOd sUc\nsOd - is static is blocked in descent, the airspeed indicator will Overread\nPUDSUC POCSOD\npUd == pitot blocked in descent - ASI under-reads SUC == stqtic blocked in Climb - ASI under-reads",

    "text": "5.10 Magnetism - Compass Reading\nhttps://www.studyaircrafts.com/compass-system\nA compass is an instrument designed to indicate direction on the surface of the earth, relative to some known datum. The magnetic compass works on the principle that a freely suspended magnet will align itself with the earth’s magnetic field such that one end will point toward the north magnetic pole.\nThe purpose of a magnetic ‘steering’ compass in an aircraft is to indicate heading, the direction in which the aircraft is pointing. Magnetic influences - iron/steel components, electric currents - distort the earth’s field so that the compass magnet assembly deviates from the magnetic meridian. This is called compass deviation.\nIt is mandatory that all civil aircraft must carry such a compass and in all but light general aviation aircraft it serves as a standby compass.​\n\n5.10.1 Deviation\nAircraft manufacturing –&gt; magnetisation; aircraft degaussing.\nResidual magnetism which can influence compass readings.\nOther sources: cargo\nDistortion of Earth’s magnetic field, or electrical fields (e.g. aircraft equipment)\n\n\n5.10.2 Factors affecting Deviation\nDeviation experienced by an aircraft is specific to each aircraft and varies with heading and magnetic latitude.\nVariation with heading occurs as resultant aircraft fields oppose Earth’s field, both + or -. On which headings this happens is dependent on how deviating fields are aligned with aircraft.\nVariation with magnetic latitude is due to horizontal component of Earth’s magnetic field H. It varies in strength depending on where it is detected. At the magnetic equator all the field is in H component, at the poles, the H component is weak to non-existing.\nIf H is weak, the deviating forces are proportionally stronger. Thus, deviation is greater near the poles and smaller at magnetic equator.\n\n\n5.10.3 Magnetic Direction\nVariation is the difference between true and magnetic direction/headings.\nVariation east - magnetic least.\nVariation west - magnetic best.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"./figures/inst-magnetic-variation.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.10.4 Compass Direction\nInfluence by Earth’s magnetic field.

It varies as the aircraft’s magnetic fields interfere with the Earth’s magnetic fields.\nDeviation varies with:\n\nmagnetic latitude ~ strength of Earth’s magnetic field\naircraft heading ~ orientation of aircraft and interference changes\nchanges in aircraft electrical equipment ~ different levels of interferring fields\n\n\n\n5.10.5 Calculations\nConversion of compass heading to true heading, etc.\nCadbury’s Dairy Milk is Very Tasty compass-deviation-magnetic-variation-True\ncompass heading: 222 deviation 3W: - 3 magnetic heading: 219 variation 23E: + 23 true heading: 242\nGiven true heading of 005, VAR 32W, deviation 4E.

Thus, moves from Earth horizontal detecting some vertical Z component == direction distortion.\nSteady pitch attitude up to 25 degree from level will produce no error. However, in steady balanced turns the flux detecter will stay level with respect to the aircraft and agins start to pick up Z component of magnet field ~ ditortion.\n== various sensors incorporated to detect pitch, bank, and acceleration –&gt; switching off when these parameters exceed limits set in the magnetic monitoring system.",
