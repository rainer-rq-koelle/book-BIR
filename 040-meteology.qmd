## The Atmosphere

The atmosphere is the gaseous medium enveloping our Earth and revolving with it as an integral body. The air is the basic gas composing the atmosphere, but to a very-small extent it also contains water vapor (the basic source of all fog, cloud, and precipitation) and suspended tiny microscopic solid particles called aerosols. The atmosphere gets lighter with increasing altitude. The atmosphere regulates heat, air, and moisture. It also protects us from the sun’s harmful rays and from meteoroids, and maintains the ecological balance on the Earth. Flying takes place only in the relatively denser portion of the atmosphere.

The atmosphere is a mixture of gases, including water vapour, solid particles (e.g. Dust and smoke), and some water in either solid of liquid form (e.g. clouds, mist, fog).

Composition of dry air (no water/water vapour, and solids), the concentrations of gases are constant in the lower layer of the atmosphere (i.e., troposphere):

* Nitrogen $N_2$: 78%
* Oxygen $O_2$: 21%
* Argon $AR$: 0.9% with traces of Carbon Dioxide $CO_2$ and other gases.

These are relative percentages by volume in dry air.   
Most gases are inert as far as the weather is concerned, carrying only limited amounts of energy as hot or cold air.    
The three that play an important part are the very small percentages of Carbon Dioxide, Ozone, and water vapour.

Water vapour carries the large amount of **latent (heat) energy**. It is a light transparent gas.
It averages less than 1% by volume, with the local concentration of water vapour varying significantly from 0.001% in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to about 4% in hot and humid air masses.    
Most of the water vapour in the atmosphere is found at low altitudes and in areas with higher air temperature, i.e., the tropics.

The sun's energy reaches the earth as short wave radiation, and little is absored or reflected before it warms the earth's surface.   
Long wave readiation is then emitted back into the atmosphere from below/the surface.
Some of this long wave radiation is absorbed by the carbon dioxide and water vapour.
This absorption is causing the ***greenhouse gas effect***.

Ozone, an allotrope of oxygen made of 3 oxygen atoms rather than the usual two, is most concentrated in a layer in the upper stratosphere between 50 000 and 100 000ft (15 to 30 km).     
Ozone absorbs harmful UV radiation from the sun. As the UV radiation is absorbed it causes a temperature increase in the upper atmosphere. The maximum heating occurs at the top of the ozone layer ~ 160 000ft (50km).

### Temperature 

Temperature is the most significant quantity which influences pressure and density of the air. 
The differential heating on Earth causes weather changes.

Air temperature is directly a measure of the average kinetic energy of air molecules. It is a physical quantity indicating the degree of heat or coldness of air.

### Pressure and Density

In the atmosphere, there is a fixed relationship between temperature, pressure, and volume.    
The general gas law is

$$Pressure * Volume = R * Temperature$$
$R$ a gas constant.    
In meteorology we are most concerned with the **density** of the air/atmosphere.

Density is defined as the mass of a unit volume of a gas, for a fixed mass of air, density is inversely proportional to volume.    
This means that as the volume increases, the density decreases.

$$\frac{1}{Volume} = \frac{Pressure}{R * Temperture}$$
Substituting $Density ~ \frac{1}{Volume}$ 
$$Density \alpha \frac{Pressure}{R * Temperature}$$
Thus, density is directly proportional to pressure, and inversely proportional to Temperature.

$$Density \alpha \frac{Pressure}{Temperature}$$
This relationship is crucial for the development of the vertical movement in the atmosphere, i.e. **convection**. 
At constant temperature, decreasing pressure --> air less dense
at constant pressure, decreasing temprature  --> air density increases.

Air which is warmer than its surrounding - and therefore less dense - will rise and continue to rise.
Air that is colder than its surroundings will sink.

### Pressure

Pressure which is a force per unity area is measured in (milli)bars.
ICAO uses hPa: 1hPa == 1 mb.

Average pressure of the atmosphere at sea level: 1013.25mb/hPa ~ 29.92 in(ches of mercury).    
Pressure is commonly measured by a barometer

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/met-pressure-mercury.jpg")
```


Surface pressure chart --> barometric pressure measurements from many observation stations recorded on surface weather charts. 
For a first overivew of the pressure distribution is achieved by joining points having equal air pressure, i.e. **isobars**.

Next to overview of the pressure distribution, the surface weather chart gives an estimation of the wind direction and speed at any point on the chart.


### Density

Density (in meteorology) is measured in grams per cubic meter.

* dry air - pressure 1013.25 hPa, temp 15 C ==> density: $1225 g/m_3$
* water vapour -''-     ==> $760 g/m_3$

Water vapour (at sea level) has a density of about 760 g/m3 ~ about half of the density of dry atmosphere.   
Thus, if water vapour is the air mixture (i.e., not dry air), the density is lower for the same conditions.
Moist air is less dense than dry air at the same temperature and pressure.

Air density decreases with altitude.     
On average, the air density is half of that of sea level at 22 000ft, and a quarter of the sea level at 40 000ft.

### ISA - International Standard Atmosphere

ICAO has defined a standard atmosphere for instrument calibration and as benchmark for comparison.   
The average values for sea level pressure, temperature, and density were taken as the starting point and the average change of the temperature with height added in.

The ICAO Standard Atmosphere (ISA) is a model used to represent the average conditions of the Earth's atmosphere. It assumes a mean sea-level pressure of 1013.25 hPa and a temperature lapse rate of 6.5 °C per kilometer up to the tropopause, which is typically at 11 km altitude. The ISA serves as a reference for comparing actual atmospheric conditions at any given time and location, helping in various applications in aviation and meteorology. 
Oxford Reference
+3

Key properties of the ISA include:
Pressure: Decreases with altitude.
Temperature: Also decreases with altitude until the tropopause.
Density: Varies with altitude, affecting aircraft performance. 

This model is essential for flight planning and performance calculations in aviation.

### Calculating ISA Deviation

To correct from ISA to real world, the deviation from ISA needs to be calculated.
I.e., the difference between the calculated ISA value for temperature at a specific height and the real environmental termperature, the outside air temperature OAT.

Often OAT given --> determine associated ISA temperature by using lapse rate of 2C per thousand feet from a surface/sea level temperature of 15C --> typically close enough to get ther right answer.

$$T_{ISA} = 15 - (height in 1000ft * 2)$$ 
or
$$T_{ISA} = 15 - (height in km * 6.5)$$
deviation from ISA: $OAT - T_{ISA}$.
if $OAT > T_{ISA}$ - deviation positive

Example:

OAT at FL100 := -8C
==> ISA at FL100: 15 -(10 * 2) = 15 - 20 = -5
OAT colder ==> deviation -3C   (or OAT - T_ISA = -8 -(-5) = -3)


Beware of ISA temperature above 11km (36090ft) and up to 20km (65817ft) is constant at -56.5C

OAT at 39000ft is -45C - what is the ISA deviation
OAT -TISA = -45 -(-56.5) = 11.5 degree    
OAT warmer than TISA, i.e. positive deviation!


What is the OAT at FL240, if it is ISA + 7?

ISA at FL240 = 15 - (24 * 2) = 15 - 48 = -33    
OAT := ISA + 7 = -33 + 7 = -26C


Temp at FL80 = 6C, what at FL130 if standard lapse rate
FL130 - FL80 = 5000ft --> lapse: 5 * 2 = 10 ==> 6 - 10 = -4C

## Radiation

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/met-radiation.png")
```


## Altimetry

Altimeters can be adjusted to read heights above a certain datum. 

* **height (above ground)**: QFE (field elevation) - station pressure: 0 at ground
* **altitude (above MSL)**:  QNH (nautical height ~ nautical ~ MSL) - station pressure QFE adjusted to mean sea level using ISA for termperature: station elevation on ground = field elevation.
* **pressure altitude / FL**: standard pressure 1013.25mb: pressure altitude (typically given in FL) 

* QFF station pressure adjusted to MSL using the actual station temperature and the actual lapse rate (including surface inversions) ==> used by meteorological service as accurate value for the air pressure at MSL.

QNH used GND - transition altitude (regional QNH); regional QNH is the lowest of all the forecast QNH values for maximum safety margin.
QFE is the pressure of the highest point of the airfield (if needed separate touchzondn point/zone QFE)

QNE is the touchdown height if altimeter set to standard/1013.25mb = pressure altitude of the trouchdown.

If temperature and lapse rate are in accordance to ISA: QNH == QFF.

For stations above sea level:

* temperature warmer than ISA: QNH > QFF
* coder than ISA: QNH < QFFf

stations below sea level
* tmep warmer than ISA: QNH < QFF
* temp colder than ISA: QNH > QFF

CHANGING SUB-SCALE SETTING   
By definition, if the reference datum is changed, the indicated height will change!

Example: take-off altimeter is set to QNH 1003 hPa. Transition altitude is 3000ft.    
As aircraft passes through transition altitude, the pilot sets altimeter to 1013.25mbar.


3000ft --------------------------------- 3270ft
|                                            |
|                                            |
1003hPa       = 10hPa --> 10 * 27 = 270ft ---|
|------------ 1013                        ---|


### Temperature Error

True altitude will differ from indicated altitude, if the temperature differs from ISA.   
In high temperature air masses, any given pressure level will be at a greater altitude than in cold air masses.

Altimeters measure pressure. Thus, the altimeter will show the same altitude at the same pressure level irrespective of any termperature difference.

                                ------------
                                |           |
--------------- 700 hPa ----------------------- "altimeter measures pressure"
            |              |    |           |
---------|  |              |    |   warm    |
  cold   |  |    ISA air   |    |   air     |
  air    |  |              |    |           |
------------ 1013 hPa --------------------------

In ISA conditions, the 700hPa level is almost exactly at 10 000ft.
In cooler air, the 700hPa level -- which the altimeter reads at 10 000ft -- is significantly lower.
(Im winter sind the Berge höher!)      
In low temperatures the altimeter **over-reads**.     
In warm air, it under-reads.

Thus, air mass temperature deviation from ISA makes no relative difference to height keeping for air traffic reasons, as all aircraft will be subject to the saem error.     
However, the absolute separation between pressure levels is reduced in cold air.    
E.g. while there is a height separation of 1000ft between DL300 and FL310, the separation is less than 1000ft  in cold air, while it increases in warm air.

```



Temperature Error correction    

best done with flight computer --> rule of thumb:

1. barometric error can be calculated separately - do this first
2. temp correction applies to the band of atmosphere between the level where the altimeter reads correctly and the aircraft. This datum level is station elevation for airfields QNH and touchdown QFE. If sea level pressure QFF is given, the datum is sea level.
3. ISA deviation can be assumed to be the same at all heights.
4. pressure are whole milibars rounded down.
5. 4% height difference in true altitude from indicator altitude for every 10C difference in air mass temperature (every 10C of ISA temperature deviation).

4% of height difference for every 10C of termperature difference     
4% * (height in thousands of feet) * ISA deviation.

Example:
flight in FL200. OAT = -40C, pressure at sea level 1033hPa.    
What is the true altitude?

-------- PA = FL200 = 20 000ft

--- standard 1013
                    20hPa * 27ft = 540ft
--- MSL = 1033hPa

ISA @ FL200: 15 - (20[000] * 2) = 15 - 40 = -25
"check Otis": ISA dev = OAT - TISA = -40 - (-25) = -15

temp correction error: 4% * 15/10 * 20 540ft = 4 / 100 * 30 810ft = 308 * 4 = 1232ft

temp is colder than ISA = altimeter overreads == 20540 - 1232 = 19308ft   
true altitude lower thn indicated!

flight in FL100, temp dev -15C, pressure at sea level 983hPa

--------- PA = FL100 = 10000ft

---  MSL: 983 ------------------------------> ALT = 10.000 - 810 = 9190ft
                      30hPa * 27ft = 810ft
---- standard 1013

ISA dev = -15
temp correction 4% 15/10 * 9190ft = 4/100 * ... 551.4  9190 - 551

### Relationship between QNH and QFF
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTfM0-ysCsk
QNH is calculated from station pressure assuming ISA conditions.    
QFF is the actual sea level pressure.

If temperature different from ISA, QNH and QFF will be different.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/met-QNH-QFF.png")
```

relationship reverses for aerodromes below sea level (how realistic). In colder air QNH > QFF.

### Temperature Correction

why is QNH on the ground give you correct airfield altitude above mean sea level?

--> altimeter is calibrated to ISA.
--> QNH assumes barometric lapse rate: 27ft ~ 1 hPa

For QFF, we would need to correct for the temperature to get the correct reading on the ground.

**If the temperature differs from ISA, the QNH will only read the correct altitude on the ground.**
If you are airborne the altitude needs to be corrected for the temperature to obtain the **true altitude**.

In warm conditions this is not dangerous. True altitude willbe higher than indicator.
However, in cold air, true altitude lower than indicator (Berge höher)!

==> temp error correction for minimum descent heights and decision heights in very cold conditions.
The amount to add on the indicated height or altitude is usually derived from correction tables.

Temperature correction example


Definitions
* altitude - above AMSL
* elevation - ground point AMSL
* height - point or level (altitude minus elevation)
* pressure altitude - indicated altitude with standard pressure
* flight level - pressure altitude in abbreviated form
* true altitude - the result of correcting a pressure altitude for both i.) pressure (barometric) and ii.) termperature deviations from ISA. Baro correction performed first to give an indicated altitude, which is what the altimeter would read with QNH set. Then, temp correction for True Altitude.
* True Height - true altitude minus elevation

QFE
QNH
QFF - station pressure reduced to MSL using the actual station temp and lapse rate. QFF set on altimater, it would read 0 when aircaf landed at sea.


## Temperature and Heat

### Basics

Temperature is the measure of the level of molecular activity within a substance/air cell.
It is not a direct measure of the amount of energy present.

--> feasible: small hot objects that contain little energy, or large objects that contain huge amounts of heat energy.

CLEARLY SEPARATE between temperature and heat energy!

objects cooled to a temperature of absolute zero, i.e., -273degC or 0 Kelvin, all molecular activity stops.
In such a case the object contains no heat energy.

If we add energy, the temperature will increase.    
However, how much the temperature increases depends on the "material" (i.e., air composition).


By definition, units of heat energy are expressed in terms of behaviour of water.
The amount of heat energy needed to increase 1 gram of water by 1 centigrade (or Kelvin) is 1 calorie (cal).

10 cal added to  1g of water --> temperature increases by 10degrees.    
10 cal added to 100g of water --> temperature increase by $\frac{10cal}{100g} = $0.1 degrees

Water has the highest ability to **absorb** heat.     
Thus, other material will heat up more easily.

specific heat of a substance := amount of heat required for the same temperature increase.

Water has a specific heat of 1.0.    
Most common other substances have specific heat values of (much) less than 1.0.     
For example, ice has a specific heat of approx. 0.5.

Thus, 

* 1 cal --> raise temperature of 1g of water by 1 degree C
* 0.5 cal --> to raise temp of 1g ice by 1 degree C, and 
* e.g. 0.25 cal --> to raise temp of 1g of rock by 1 degree C.

This explains how oceans (water) and land masses respond to sun energy.   
The sea stays more or less at the same temperature (day ~ absorption of energy, night ~ re-radiation) during day and night, winter and summer, while    
land masses heat up quickly and cool down quickly.

### Heating of Troposphere

The sun heats the atmosphere by radiation.    
The earth heats the atmosphere by radiation, conduction, and convection.

**Radiation**    
Earth has a lower temperature than the sun. Earth radiates this energy at a longer wavelength ~ 10 micron band.
Low level radiation is absorbed in water vapour and carbon dioxide, and by clouds.
This heats the troposphere/atmosphere, especially at the lower troposphere where water vapour and clouds are at maximum.   

Some long wave reradiation is re-radiated and reflected back to earth. 
Maximum reflection occurs in overcast conditions (~ reflective shield/layer of clouds)

**Convection**    
Heat transfer (aloft) can occur as a vertical movement of air.   
* forced convection - air forced up over a range of mountains, or mechanical turbulence in the lee of hills or mountains;
* thermal convection - heated air having a lower density than its surrounding will rise.

Rising air carries energy aloft in two forms:     
* ordinary heat energy
* latent heat energy

As the air rises and cools, water vapour in the air cell may condense to form clouds.
Through the forming of clouds, the air releases its latent energy / latent heat of condensation.

**Advection**    
Advection is the horizontl movement of air, i.e., wind.   
Advection only transfers energy horizontally.     
This means advection is not heating the troposhere. It only "re-distributes" the energy within it.(affects stability of air)

Thermal advection can be divided into    

* warm air advection (WAA) - movement of warm air toward a fixed point on a horizontal plane, e.g. warm fronts and ahead of cold fronts. Warm air advection "contributes" to rising air as warm air is less dense than cool air (as warm air expands to a larger volume than cold air). This expansion pushes the warm air above the low (denser/colder) air.
The upward movement is slow and the rate that the air rises is much less than the rate the air rises in an updraft of a thunderstorm.

* cold air advection (CAA) - movement of colder air toward a fixed point on a horizontal plane. CAA is common behind cold fronts. Cold air advection contributes to sinking air because cold air is denser than warm air. Cooler air has contracted more than warmer air, and this contraction in the low levels forces a sinking motion aloft to compensate for the reduction of volume in the lower levels.     
Thus, in an ideal case, the skies will be clear behind cold fronts.

There is **not a direct relationship between thermal advection and the resultant vertical motion** in the atmosphere, as other lifting/lowering mechanisms play a role as well.
Evaporative cooling, condensation cooling, solar heating, complex topography, and radiational cooling contaminates thermal advection.     
A forecaster will examine these factors to determine the actual magnitude of the resultant thermal advection. For example, the warming and uplift from WAA will be reduced in cases where precipitation is falling into the low levels and cooling the air through evaporation.

### Diurnal Variation of Surface Temperature

The daily (or diurnal) variation in surface temparture is important.
It influences the formation of radiation fog, land and sea breezes, and the development of convective cloud during the day.

The balance between incoming and outgoing radiation is shown in the figure (typical day over land, May or September, middle latitudes, with sunrise at 0600 local mean time LMT and sunset at 1800 LMT)

```{r}
#| out-width: 70%
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/met-diurnal-deficit-surplus.png")
```

surplus in exceeding area. deficit below the longwave radiation.

expectation that surface temperature would decrease during radiation deficit.    
However, multiple factors at play. With (daily) increase in temperature, thermal convection begins and winds mix the air (even turbulent mixing). Calm nights can see higher cooling of earth, ... see breezes ... clouds. 

Figure could be overlaid with clear skies and overcast "Deckel"/blanket.
Clouds limit incoming radiation and reflect back the the outgoing re-readiation. Thus, reducing a reduction in temperature.    
Thick clouds are more effective. Clouds with low bases are efficient in reducing the daytime maximum termperature and diurnal temperature rante DTR. High/middle clouds less effective.

Overall effect: minimum surface temperature occur at about 30 minutes after sunrise, max temp at tow/three hours past mid-day.   
Cloud blanket "dampens" the variation of the temperature.

## Moisture and Convection

Increase in temperature --> higher molecular activity --> some molecules to escape (liquid) to gas state.
Increase in pressure --> resistance to 'escape'.

Water will continue to evaporate until the concentration of water vapour reaches a point where the water vapour pressure is high enough to "push back" water molecules at the same rate as they are escaping.
The air is then **saturated** with water vapour.     
This is known as the **saturation vapour pressure (SVP)**.

If the air subsequently cools, the gas pressure will push some vapour back to the water state.
This is visible as cloud fog or dew.     
The concentration of water vapour will decrease until the temperature and gas pressure are in equilibrium again.

The saturation water pressure depends ONLY on the TEMPERATURE and the EVAPOURATING SURFACE.

The SVP is slightly lower over ice than over supercooled water at the same temperature (below 0 degrees [ice melts for T > 0]).
If unsaturated air is cooled below 0 degrees C, the frost point is reached before the dew point. 
Hoar frost forms.

### Saturated Air

Air at low temperatures reaches saturation at very low concentrations of water vapour.    
At 15C, air saturates at a 2% concentration; at 30C at about 4% concentration.   

This explains why the average concentration of water vapour in the troposphere is generally so low.    
Consequently, the majority of water vapour will be found in areas with warm air, i.e., tropics.

### Atmospheric Humidity

**humid** marks a relatively high level of water vapour in the atmosphere.

Water vapour constitutes (only) 0-4% of the total volume of the atmosphere.   
However, it is the most important determinant of waether and climate:

* water vapour condenses to form precipitation. The potential for precipitation is determined by the amount of water vapour.
* water vapour is an active absorber and emitter of infrared radiation. It affects heating and cooling of the atmosphere and surface.
* latent heat releases when vapour condenses or freezes. == energy source for atmosphereic motion and convective weather systems.
* vertical transport of water vapour, through cumulous convection is the most important mechanism for upward transport of heat in the atmosphere.
* the amount of water vapour influences the rate of surface evaporation and transpiration. (Humans and animals are uncomfortable in highly humid conditions that impede the rate of perspiration. At low humidity levels --> dehydration)

The main sources of water vapour in the lower atmosphere are the evaporation from the surface and transpiration by plants.    
In the stratosphere, the breakdown of methane by sunlight.

**vapour pressure** - partial pressure of air that is exerted by water vapour (hPa or mb)    
**absolute humidity** - mass of water vapour per unit volume of space, grams per cubic meter $\frac{g}{m^3}$. ~ density of water vapour.       
**specific humidity** - mass of water vapour divided by mass of air - $\frac{g}{kg}$    
**mixing ratio** - mass of water vapour divided by the mass of dry air - $\frac{g}{kg}$      
**saturation mixing ratio** - air can only hold a certain amount of water vapour at any given temperature before it is saturated. The total amount of evaporate air can hold at any given termperature by weight relatioship.     
**dew point temperature** - temperature to which air must be cooled - at constant pressure and vapour content - for saturation to occur. The frost point temperature applies to saturation of ice.
** relative humidity** - ratio of specific humidity to saturation specific humidity. The amount of water vapour compared with the amount required for saturation (at particular temperature and pressure).     
**saturation** (or equilibrium) - condition of the atmosphere when evaporation rate is equal to the condensation rate. When air is saturated, the amount of water vapour is the maximum hat air can hold at that temperature and pressure.

HUMIDITY MIXING RATIO     
The humidity mixing ratio measures the content of water vapour in the air.    
The ratio in grams of water vapour to kilogram of dry air.   
The saturation mixing ratio is the respective value corresponding to saturation.

As air gets warmer or cooler, the mixing ratio remains constant, but the relative humidity and saturation mixing ratio changes as the air is capable of holding more or less water vapour at different temperatures.

The absolute humidity is a measure of mass of water vapour per unit volume of air. Specific humidity is the same as mixing ratio (mass of water vapour per unit mass of air). These will not change as temperature changes.

More water vapour means more latent energy.    
If air cannot hold any more water vapour it is saturated.

EFFECT OF ALTITUDE     
With increasing altitude, temperature generally decreases.   
On a general level: in ISA, the saturation mixing ratio - or the mass of water vapour air can hold - decreases with height.

Note: at constant pressure and temperature, the density of the air will decrease as humidity increases. This is because for each additional molecul of water vapour, a molecule of nitrogen, oxiygen or the other gases will be replaced in order to keep the temperature and pressure constant.     
A molecule of water vapour has less mass than a molecule of any of the gases displaced. Thus, the mass of a given volume of atmosphere will decrease with increasing humidity.

* relative humidity
* dew point
* wet bulb temperature


### relative humidity

**relative humidity** tells us how much (or how much more) water vapour the air is holding compared to what it could hold.   

$\text{relative humidity} = \frac{\text{water vapour content}}{\text{water vapour capability}}$

saturated air: RH = 100% (cannot hold more water vapour)     
unsatuated air: RH < 100%

Diurnal "expectation": with increasing temperature of the atmosphere, the RH will decrease, and - after the maximum daily temperature is reached at about 1400hrs, the RH will increase as the air cools down.

Saturation mixing ratio will decrease (gently) with altitude in a normal atmosphere.   
Thus, if a parcel of air is raised up, its relative humidity will generally increase and ultimately clouds will form. Rising air cooling down can hold less water.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/met-relative-humidity-change.png")

cooling air == increasing relative humidity (air gets denser, content gets closer to capacity)
warming air == decreasing relative humidity (air expands, capacity increases 1/capacity)


### Dew Point Temperature

Relative humidity increases with cooling of an air parcel.   
Eventually, parcel temperature reaches a level with RH = 100%.    
From this temperature on down, liquid water will condense out of the mix as cloud or dew while the RH remains at 100% with reducing water vapour content, but increasing amounts of liquid water - the total water content in the parcel remains the same.     
The temperature at which this happens: dew point temperature. Can be measured directly using a dew point hygrometer.

So long water content or pressure are not altered, the dew point remains the same.   
Increasing the temperature will cuase the moisture to evaporate.   
Decreasing the temperature to the dew point will produce condensation again.

If the OAT is higher than the dew point, the air is less than saturated, i.e., less than 100% RH.   
The further apart OAT and dew point, the drier the air and the lower the RH.   
== dew point spread.

SVP over ice is slightly lower than over water --> frost will form below 0 deg before the dew point.
As frost point and dew point are very close, some references refer to frost point to describe (also) the dew point at sub-zero temperature.

**Dew point** is the temperature at which cloud or dew forms.    
The **dew point spread** tells how moist/humid the air is and indicates the relative humidity.

### Measurement of Humidity - Wet Bulb

picture - temp measurement by two thermometers. One "normal", the other with bulb wrapped in moist cloth.
Wet bulb thermometer will measure lower temp.   
As relative humidity increases, evaporation slows down, and finally ceases at saturation.

==> difference between wet bulb temperature and dry bulb temperature gives a measure of relative humidity.    
Note: wet bulb temp is not the dew point and always falls between the dew point and OAT. However, all three coincide at saturation with RH 100%.

Wet bulb and dry bulb thermometer together is knowns as "psychometer" or "Mason's hygrometer".   
Readings allow to calculate the RH.   

The wet bulb / dry bulb spread tells how dry the air is.   
The wet bulb temperature lies between dew point and OAT.

if air dry --> moisture will evaporate rapidly from the cloth.   
The latent heat needed is taken from wet bulb.

### Lapse Rates

Temperature varies with height ~ 6.5C per 1000m or 2C per 1000ft ~ ISA.   
This is the **average environmental lapse rate (ELR)**.   
In the real atmosphere, the ELR can be different from the average (ISA).

ELR is measured by a radio sonde ~ balloon carrying instruments to measure temperature, pressure and humidity.

Temperature/height diagram ~ temparture/pressure diagram, as height ~ pressure in the atmorsphere. := T/P diagram.

If the air mass has been cooled in the lower layers by conduction from a cold surface, for example, then the temperature may rise as height increaes := temp inversion.
If temp stays constant as height increases := isothermal layer.

#### Dry Adiabatice Lapse Rate

Convection taks place rapidly and the rising air does not mix with the environment.
Similar to a balloon.   
This "isolation" means that no energy will pass in or out of the rising parcel of air.   
This is called **adiabatic** := without energy gain or loss.

Rising parcel of air is moving to lower atmospheric pressure. Thus, parcel will expand.
With expansion, parcel temperature cools.   
With no energy going in or out, we can calculate the temperature decrease, as it only depends on the Gas Laws.

Rising dry air where no condensations of moisture is involved will cool adiabatically at 3C per 1000ft ~ 1C per 100m.   
This is true for all starting temperatures and all heights.
== **dry adiabatic lapse rate** DALR.

#### Saturated Adiabatic Lapse Rate

Non-dry saturated air holds all the water it can.
If such an air parcel rises, temperature cools. Thus, water vapour will condense out to water releasting internally some of the latent energy/heat.   
This internal release of heat will reduce the lapse rate := **saturated adiabatic lapse rate SALR**

The SALR is not constant. The reduction from the DALR depends on the rate at which the latent heat is released internally. This depends on the total amount of water vapour present at saturation.

At sea level in temperature climates, the SALR is about 1.8C/1000ft (0.6C per 100m).    
In the tropics, SALR can be 1C/1000ft.    
At surface temps below -20C (where the total water content at saturation is very low) is is near to the DALR.   
Ditto at higher altitudes.

==> DALR, SALR, and ELR.

DALR ~ 3deg/1000ft    
SALR ~ 1.8 deg/1000ft


### Unstable Air

ELR bigger than DALR (and SALR)

A parcel of air rising and cooled adiabatically will be "warmer" than the environment.
And at the same pressure, the air parce will be less dense and will continue to rise. 

Rising air is **unstable** in the air mass - whether saturated or not.   
If ELR is grater than DALR: "the air mass is absolutely unstable".

Rising air is always warmer than the environment ==> keeps rising.

### Stable Air

ELR very low - perhaps even negative (temperature inversion).
Accordingly, the air aloft is relatively warm.

Rising parcels are colder than the environment - no matter if cooled at DALR or SALR.
Such cooler cells are mome dense and will sink back to lower altitudes.

The airmass is *stable to rising air**.    
If ELR is less than SALR, the airmass is **absolutely stable**.

==> isothermal layers and temperature inversions are absolutely stable air portions.

### Indifferent (Neutral) Stability

Neutral stabiity is an atmospheric condition that occurs when the environmental lapse rate ELR is equal to the dry adiabatic lapse rate: ELR == DALR.

### Conditionally Unstable Air

DALR 3deg/1000ft > ELR >  1.8 deg/1000ft SALR

air is stable, if dry - but unstable if saturated!

not saturated air would follow DALR, cools, and falls back == stable.    
if saturated air parcel follows SALR, and would end up warmer than ELR == unstable
air forced to rise cools at DALR (and is stable). After reaching its dew point (base of clouds), it couls at SALE and becomes unstable.

REFLECTION

ELR is not constant all the way up to the tropopause. The air mass can have different chracteristics at different levels. I.e., being stable at low levels and unstable aloft, or being generally unstable with a stable layer at medium altitudes.

Average ELR for tropopause ~ 2deg/1000ft. Air mass stability varies widely from place to place.
Accordingly - the expectation is that - average condition for troposphere is **conditional instability**.
This means that ther is an average tendency for saturated air to rise and contine to rist.

**Super-instability** with an environmental lapse rate above DALR does not occur often.   
In such conditions, instability makes warm air rise quickly aloft and bring cold air down to replace it.
This brings the ELR back to a more normal value.

Advection of air - warm or cold - can affect stability of the atmosphere.     
Warm air advection at the surface and/or cool air advection aloft will enhance the atmosphereic instability.    
Conversely, advection of cold air at the surface can contribute to a stable atmosphere.

SUMMARY

conditions that enhance **atmospheric instability**:

* warming of surface air by
  + solar heating of ground
  + warm "advection" near surface
  + air moving over a warm surface (e.g. a warm body of water)
* cooling of air aloft by
  + cold advection aloft
  + radiative cooling of air/clouds aloft
  
conditions that contribute to a stable atmosphere

* radiative cooling of surface at night
* advection of cold air near the surface
* air moving over a cold surface (e.g. snow)
* adiabatic warming due to compression from ubsidence (sinking)

- if the ELR is less than the SALR, the air is absolutely stable, since even saturated air will cool more rapidly than the environment.
- if the ELR is between the SALR and the DALR, the air is conditionally unstable, since dry air will cool more rapidly than the environment but saturated air will not.
- if the ELR is equal to the DALR, the air is neutrally stable - but only so long as the air doesn't saturate. (You could say it is conditionally unstable too)
- if the ELR is greater than the DALR ( and therefore also the SALR) the air is absolutely unstable.

As for the value of the lapse rates, the DALR remains fairly constant at 3o / 1000ft. The SALR results from the release of latent heat when water vapoiur condenses and the rate of condensation depends on the amount of water vapour, the ambient temperature and the ambient pressure. Therefore the SALR is also dependant on these too. In fact, at sea level it is about 1.2oC/1000ft but at 18000ft, it is about 2.4oC/1000ft.


## Clouds 

WMO defines cloud as "... a hydrometeor consisting of minute particles of liquid water or ice, or of both, suspended in the atmosphere and usually not touching the ground. It may also include larger particles of liquid water or ice, as well as non-aqueous liquid or solid particples such as those present in fumes, smoke, or dust.

Cloud formation: air at the surface is normally not saturated and has a RH of less than 100%, and a dew point and a wet bulb temperature lower than OAT.    
If the air parcel rises, if will cool down at the DALR initially until it reaches the dew point.    
At that height, a cloud will form.   

If we assume the air parcel is forced to rise (further) - ignoring why - we can do calculations on cloud base height and temperature.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/met-cloud-formation.png")
```

example:
- air mass with surface OAT of 20C, dew point of 13C, and wet bulb temp of 16.4C ~ typical summer day.
- if air rises, the air parcel dry bulb temperature will fall at DALR, 3 deg/1000ft [is this important?], wet bulb temp at SALR 1.8deg/1000ft

air parcel dew point decreases with height ~ dew point lapse rate ~ 0.7C/1000ft.

The wet and dry bulb temperatures are converging at $DALR - SALR = 1.2 deg/1000ft$.

All three temperatures will coincide at cloud base.

==> $T - T_{wb} = 20 - 16.4 = 3.6$ -->$3.6 / 1.2 deg/1000ft$ --> 3000ft.

Temperature at cloud-base: OAT = 20C --> 20C - 3deg/1000ft * 3000ft = 20 - 9 = 11C


example 2: OAT at surface 15C, wet bulb temp 9C.    
What is height and temperature at cloud base?

OAT - Twb = 15C - 9C = 6C    
converging at 1.2C/1000ft: $\frac{6 C}{1.2 \frac{C}{1000ft}} = (6 / 1.2)*1000ft = 5000ft$   
==> cloud base at 5000ft

temp lapse: $OAT - DALR*Height = 15C - 3*5 = 0C$    
==> temp at base 0C


example: cloud base in 3000ft with an OAT of 5C.     
What would be the OAT, wet bulb and dew point on the surface.

cloud base ==> OAT(3000ft) == T_wb(3000ft) == T_d(3000ft)

$DALR * Height = 3 deg/1000ft * 3000ft = 9$, $OAT_{GND} - 9 = 5 ==> T_{GND} = 5 + 9 = 14$
$SALR * Height = 1.8 deg/1000ft * 3000ft = 5.4$ ==> $T_{wb} = 5 + 5.4 = 10.4$

dew point must be "slightly" higher that dew point at cloudbase, but lower than wet bulb temperature at surface. ==> pick respective multiple choice answer!

cloud base approx
$(T_surface - T_dewpoint) * 400$

### Thermodynamic diagrams - Tephigrams

Meteorologists use accurate graphs of temperature and pressure height --> thermodynamic diagram.
These are based on radiosonde readings for the analysis of the actual state of the atmosphere.

???

Thermodynamic diagrams contain 5 sets of lines:

* pressure (isobars)
* temperature (isotherm)
* dry adiabatic lapse rate - solid green lines sloping upwards - change in temperature that an unsaturated air parcel would undergo, if moved up and expands because of pressure
* saturated adiabatic lapse rate - solid blue lines - saturation adiabats - show temperature change that a saturated air paces undergoes when vertically displaced. Appear as curves with slopes ranging from 0.2C/100m in warm air new surface to 1C/100m when approaching dry adiabats.
* saturation mixing ratio - dotted blue lines. Saturation mixing ratio is the theoretical maximum amount of water vapour that an air cell at a specific temperature and pressure can hold. When saturated, air cannot hold any additional water vapour.

pressure and temperature define the thermodynamic state of an air parcel of unit mass at any time. 
Thus, any point (P,T) gives a parcels position with respect to temp and pressure.

## Convection - Triggers

triggers for surface air to rise:

* orographic trigger - air mass is forced to rise over rising ground, hills, or mountains. "Orographic" ~ dp with mountains.
* thermal trigger - heating of air in lower layers. For example, seasonal or daytime heating of the surface, or from local areas that are particularly hot (i.e., factories or power stations).
* frontal surface / meeting of air masses - warmer air will be forced to rise over the colder air := frontal convergence.
* non-frontal convergence - surface air is moving and converging and the only way out is "up". convergence of low-level winds is associated with rising air and convection.
* turbulence at low level, usually with strong winds in the lee of mountains.

### Orographic Triggers

If the air mass is unstable, any rising ground will trigger immediate convection.
This will continue up to form cloud when the rising air cools down to its dew point.

If the air is very dry, a cloud never form, but the convection (rising of air) will be there.
"Blue thermals" ~ glider flying.

If the air is absolutely stable, then no matter how high the mountains, the air will sink back down on the lee side. There will be no convection.

However, if the stable air is lifted to a level where the temperature is below the dew point, stratiform cloud will form. The cloud will not rise much higher that the high ground which is causing the lifting.

Conditionally unstable air. --> initial rising at an (average) ELR of 2C/1000ft (ELR < DALR).
If the air was forced to continue to rise, would first cool at DALR until it reaches its dew point.
At that momment cloud forming would begin.
If it is forced to rise further, it cools at SALR. 
Once ELR = SALR, air turns unstable.

The air becomes unstable when the line for the rising air crosses the ELR, marked as the instability level.    
It will then continue to rise unaided until the ELR intersects SALR (ELR rate reducing, slow warming).
:= cloud top level.     
In practice, the vertical momentum of the air carries it a few thoughsand feet above the crossover point.

Faced with three different orographic triggers, shown in diagram, what will happen?     

1. Passing over the small mountain, the air will not cool enough to form a cloud, nor will it be unstable ELR < DALR: ==> sinks back on downwind side of mountain.

2. with higher mountain, the air rises high enough to form cloud, but remains stable ELR < SALR.  
==> sinks back down forming a (mountain) "cap" cloud.

3. with higher mountain, cloud forms, air turns unstable with ELR > SALR, and cloud continues to rise.
These large coulds drift away from downside of mountain.

The "size" of the orographic trigger determines how conditionally unstable airmass reacts.   
Big lifts increase the likelihood of instability.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/met-orographic-lift-triggers.jpg")
```

If the airmass with same ELR and surface OAT (20C, WB 17C) had more moisture content.
Dew point increased to 14C.

==> would produce cloud base at 2500ft ==> stable cloud now forming on smallest mountain.     
==> middle mountain would push airmass into instability, when ELR intersects SALR and ELR > SALR

unstable convective cloud will build to higher maximum height.

Adding moisture to conditionally unstable air mass increases its tendency toward instability, and in unstable air masses moist air gives lower cloud bases and higher tops.

The more moisture:
* the more likelihood of instability
* the lower the cloudbase, and
* the higher the cloud tops.

### Thermal triggers

Thermal tiggers when air parcel near the surface is heated by conduction and by radiation from the surface.   
Heated parcel turns less dense than its surrounding and will start to rise.

If airmass absolutely unstable, will trigger full convection.    
Cloud or blue thermal will form based on water content.

If air is absolute stable, no convection, although the low-level heating will produce some low-level mixing and turbulence.

condiationally unstable air masses   

example
--> ELR ~ 2C/1000ft, surface OAT = 18C and Dewpoint 14C ==> air is stable at surface as it is not saturated.

--> during day/heating: OAT = 20C == less dense than surrounding ==> lift and cooling at DALR    
air parel climbs to ELR = DALR == convection stops.    
==> convection and turbulence in the lower levels, but no cloud (not yet reached dew point line). no change at higher altitudes.

air rising at DALR meets ELR == stability.    
The first effect of heating from surface is low-level turbulence.

--> with continuing surface temperature increae --> rising air with higher surface temperature.   
==> interception of dew point line before reaching the ELR.    
Rising air is unstable / cloud forms.    
Rising air DALR to SALR; ELR > SALR = instability

2nd effect of surface heating: convective cloud.

--> further rise in surface temperature, pushes "curves" in TP diagram further right.    
==> higher cloudbase as DALR and dew point line intersect at higer levels.; coudtops also higher (more latent energy / more climb).

rising air meest the dew point line while still warmer than the environment == condensation a. Cools at SALR = instability     
== higher base, higher cloud tops.

Starting from higher temperature, air has to rise higher to cool to dew poin / condense and form cloud.    
Heating during the day leads to higher cloudbases and higher tops.


Heating is major factor in "destabilising" air. If the air is moist, the whole convective effect is accentuated., with cloud coming earlier in the day at lower cloudbases and higher tops.


### Frontal Convergence

Convergence of two air masses with different temperature, water content.
The "warmer" air being less dense will rise over the colder air.
If the air is moving rapidly, the uplift will be more intense.

stronger convection: cold front.    
slower effect: warm front --> strati?

### Non-frontal Convergence

Even in air masses with no significant difference in temperature, low level winds can converge.
At convergence, the will have to rise producing instability and convection.

Converging streamlines, air velocity will increase and the pressure decreases.

resulting combination: surface converge, low pressure and rising air.     
On the opposite: surface divergence, high pressure and subsiding air go together.

non-frontal convergece are found in troughs of low pressure and at the inter-tropical convergence zone with converging trade winds


### Turbulence

Turbulence in the lee of high ground or over rough terran can produce a layer of cloud.
This effect only occurs, if the air mass is stable.    
By definition: air mass with an ELR less than 1.8C/1000ft (SALR).    
The air has to be moist and the wind speed needs to be fairly high in order to generate sufficienty strong turbulense.

some wild air heating taking down at DALR, climbing, mixing ... do not get it.

Turbulence has changed the temperature structure of the air mass in the turbulence layer.   
The ELR has become DALR = 3C/1000ft, and the air below half the layer height is hotter that it used to be, while the air above half way is cooler that it used to be.

If enough moisture, the additional cooling in the top half of the turbulence layer will produce cloud.

The change in temperature structure within the turbulence layer has generated a sharp rise in temperature :== inversion at the top of the layer as cooler top turbulence layer temperature goes back to ELR (actual temperature of surrounding air).    
ELR unchanged above turbulence layer.

Turbulence has not changed the totel heat energy in the layer, but has redistributed it.
Turbulence cloud layers will get deeper at night and the cloud will be more dense.

## Cloud Formation and Dissipation Process Summary

stabilty/lapse-rates/cloud formation: https://www.bom.gov.au/aviation/data/education/atmospheric-stability-aero-diagram.pdf

### Formation

vertical motion is the primary method of cooling air that leads to cloud formation. Ther are two atmosphereic cooling processes:

* adiabatic process = change of temperature of a parcel of air due to the air rising adiabatically or sinking adiabatically. Adiabatic process assumes that no heat, mass or mementum pass across the air parcel boundary.
* diabatic process - temperature change of air not related to its adiabatic vertical dsplacement.

Adiabatic cooling processes:

* convection due to heating of the ground (e.g. unorganised lifting into thin layers, fair-wetather cumulus)
* convection due to cold air passing over a warm surface (e.g. cloud streets over warm water)
* convection due to convective instability aloft (altocumulus castellanus)
* forced lifting by orographic ascent
* forced lifting by frontal ascent
* rotational pressure reduction (e.g. funnel clouds, tornadoes, wing tip vorices)

Diabatic (non-adiabatic) cooling processes:

* mixing of air of different termpatures (e.g. breath in cold air and contrails)
* fog (e.g. radiation fog and advection fog)
* turbulent mising in the boundary layer (a mixture of mixing and adiabatic coolding)

### Dissipation

Three primary processes for cloud dissipation - can combine in combination)

* temperature increase - with higher temperature, the air has a higher capcaity to evaprate liquid water. Increasing temperature and thus evaporation reduces the ligquid moister content of the cloud.  Cloud warming by solar radiation and longwave emissions from earth.

* cloud mixing with direr air - a cloud does not remain perfectly adiabatic. Som envionmental air does mix into the cloud mass. If a cloud is no longer develloping and not adding additional condensational moisture, the drier environmental air will graduallyeore the cloud. --> entrainment - cloud looks wispy with not well defined edges. During entrainment, drier air incorporates itself into the cloud and induces evaporation..

* air sinking within the cloud - sinking air warms adiabatically. Warming will induce evaporation and erosion of the cloud. aDynamic sinking mechanisms or increases over a cloud or cloud field, e.g. lowe level cold air advection, low level divergence, and downslope flow.

## Inversions

Inversion ~ temperature increase with height ==> inhibits convection.

4 ways of inversions: at fronts, from surface cooling, from subsidence in stable air masses, and above turbulence.

### Inversion at Fronts

When 2 dissimilar air masses meet, the warm(er) air will settle over the cold(er) air because of their different densities.

The frontal slop is shallpw (typically 1 in 50 to 1 in 150). Passing from cold to warm air the environmental temperature OAT will rise at the frontal surface.

### Surface cooling

When the surface is cool, e.g. during night of winter season, the air in the lower layers will be cooled by conduction.    
Cooling from below makes the air more stable == no convection or turbulence in strong winds to mix low-level air.
Thus, air can cool sufficiently to produce temperature inversion from 100 to about 1000ft

Surface cooling inversion can be a take-off hazard, as the aircraft climnbs into progressively warmer air and perforamcne degrades soon after take off. Extreme cases; aircraft trapped below inversion and unable to climb. (?!?!)

### Subsidence in Stable Air Masses

air rising in one place is balanced by air subsiding in another place. 
Subsiding air warms at DALR increasing the temperature aloft as the subsidence develops.

This typ of inversion starts at high level, and gradually sinks during the file of the subsiding air mass.
When it reaches the level where the air is no longer able to subside and must diverge ~ 2000-3000ft.

Subsiding air and surface divergence means high surface pressure.   
Such inversions are typical for well established highs (in particular sub-tropical high pressure systems.)
You can also see the effect of this sort of inversion on fine summer days over Europe where there is marked layer of poor visibility trapped by the inversion below 2000ft or so.

### Turbulence Inversion

Near surface turbulence creates inversions due to mixing of air, can possibly form a turbulence cloud.

When there is a turbulence layer in dry air, it is easy to calculate the temperature involved afte the air has mixed.

Example:
- dry stable air mass, ELR of 1.5C/1000ft, surface OAT of 15C
- turbulence layer forms in the lee of hills
- top of turbulence layer is at 3000Ft GND.

What will be the new surface OAT, and the OAT in the top of the turbulence layer?

surface to top of turbulence layer --> ELR: 

$OAT_{3000ft} = OST_{GND} - ELR * Height = 15C - \frac{1.5C}{1000ft} * 3000ft = 15C - 4.5C = 10.5C$

air from surface will rise (turbulence mixed) to 3000ft be cooling at DALR (dry stable air)

$T = OAT_{GND} - DALR * Height = 15C - 3*3C = 6C$

air from top will descend (turbulence mixed) warming at DALR

10.5 + 3*3C = 19.5

==> new surface OAT = average of old OAT 15C and mixed top layer air 19.5 == 17.25C
==> new top player temperature = avg of old T 10.5 and raised air 6C == 8.25C


Note: that is a 2.25C temperature inversion as you leave the top of the turbulence layer and revert to ELR that existed before the onset of the turbulence.   
Nothing has changed in the air above the turbulence layer.

Value of inversion "direct calculation"

$$\Delta T_{inversion} = \frac{(DALR-ELR)}{2}* \text{height turbulence layer}$$
With this: $\Delta T_{inv} = \frac{3-1.5}{2} * 3=\frac{4.5}{2} = 2.25$

==> new surface: OAT + 2.25 = 17.5     
==> top layer temp: OAT3000ft - 2.25 = 10.5 - 2.25 = 8.25


### Valley Inversion

In mountain valeys on a clear night radiation cooling on the valley sides produces cold air that slides down into the valley bottom. ~ katabatic effect.   
The "pooling" of cold air at the bottome of the valley creates the inversion with warmer air at higher heights.

### Effects of Inversions on Aircraft in Flight

* poor(er) visibility - inversion prevent the rise and dispersal of pollutants from the loer layers of the atmosphere ~ trapping of pollution material. Reduced visibility also in combination with smog, dust, and possibly fog.   Strong inversion can cause distant objects to appear as they float abouve ground.

* turbulence and wind shear - inversions signal stable (and smooth) air, howver, the crossing from one to the other air mass can come with turbulence and wind shears.

* climb out performance - climb out from cold (dense) air to warm air will result in reduced rate of climb and change in airspeed, and subsequently reduction in lift and thrust (due to lower density of warmer air).

### Inversion Summary

* ground - nocturnal radiation inversion or advection inversion = most common inversion is radiation inversion. Earth cooling by night through longwave radiation emission. Can also form when warm air moves over cold(er) surface (advection).
* subsidence - aera of high pressure, air will sink with few cm/sec. Subsiding air warms by compression (adiabaitc warming), 2000-6000ft.
* frontal - border between 2 air masses with differing temp. warm over cold.. Inversion in transition zone between the two air masses.
* turbulence / friction layer - turbulent mixing of the air in the riction layer, air adopts a DALR temp gradient. top layer ~ top friction layer = inversion
* valley - at night valley sides cool and air sinks to bottom katabatically.

Clearing of inversions: heating from below   
--> typically: daytime heating over land
--> change of weather pattern bringing in new air mass (with different temperature) 

### Influence Inversions on Cloud Development

**influence on vertical movement**     

Buoyancy in the atmosphere is determined by the vertical gradient of temperature.   
Inversion can prevent the rise of air from lower layers, as the warm(er) air acts as a lid preventing the vertical movement.

**influence on formation of Stratus clouds**

Temperature inversions are responsible for certain cloud formations.

When clouds form below the inversion, they "spread out" and have a flat smooth appearance.    
Often seen over cool ocean waters.
The inversion caps the marine boundary layer, preventing the cool moist marine air from mixing with warm dry air above.    
Relative humidity allows for saturation forming stratus clouds just below base of inversion.

**influence of a ground inversion on formation of fog**

Ground inversion develops with air being cooled by contact with cold(er) surface.   
Happens mostly on clear nights with the ground cooling rapidly (radiation emission).   
If temperature of the cooled surface air drops below dew point, fog may result.

Very common in higher altitudes.    
Surface temperature inversion in lower and middle latitudes occurs during cold nights and gets destroyed during daytime (morning fog).

**influence of inversion on Height of Cumulus Clouds**

Convection controlled by buyoance relative to thermal's surroundings.
When ascending bubbles encounter an inversion (temp increases with height), air parcels tend to lose their relative buyoanccy and spread out sideways.     
An inversion will often delineat the top of the cumulus cloud.


## Wind

(first force) Pressure gradient force H --> L.
PGF is the the tendancy of air to move from areas of HIGH to LOW pressure.

Across the surface of Earth, there is considerable variation of air pressure.
Thus, air will flow from H --> L.

map of surface pressure by joining places of equal pressure.
lines == isobars.
isobar ~ contour lines

the closer the lines/isobars, the higher the horizontal gradient (i.e., steeper/stronger), 
and thus, the higher the wind speed.

Initially, the wind direction resulting from the PGF is across the isobars.
The deflecting force resulting from the rotation of the Earth: Coriolis.
With increasing height ==> parallel to isobars.

Note: Coriolis force makes water spin when going down a plug hole.
Coriolis force is dependent on latitude, i.e., it is stronger at Poles and zero at Equator.

### Surface Wind

Air flowing over surface --> boundary layer. Surface friction will slow air.
Within **friction layer** air velocity reduces from free-stream (higher altitudes) to much lower speed at the sufrface

Reduction depends on wind speed, the drag/friction of the surface (rough reduces more), and the conditions in the boundary layer.

Boundary layers can be classified in two types: i.) laminar and ii.) turbulent.
* **laminar** boundary layer - no vertical mixing, layers of air slide smoothly over each other --> linear decrease/increase with height from/to free-flow streem.
* **turbulent** boundary layer - some vertical mixing ~ increased friction, resulting in non-linear decrease/increase with height through the layer.

Laminar (friction) layer is typically thinner than a turbulent one.    
Turbulent about 2000ft, laminar ~ 1000-1500ft.

If wind direction is parallel with runway, but changing rapidly == caution.   
Descending into decreasing headwind and with constant airspeed, this will give increasing ground speed.   
For example 3deg glide slope, GS 150kt ~ descent rate of 750 ft/min.   
With increase in GS --> 160kt, the required descent rate is 800 ft/min. Sticking at 750 ft/min will make the aircraft go above the glide path.

### Boundary Layers

Change from laminar to turbulent depends on i.) mechanical mixing due to surface (e.g. hills) and/or ii.) thermal convection from the surface.

--> laminar layers over smooth and cold surface    
--> turbulent layers over hot and rough surface.

Primary factor affecting depth of boundary layer: stability, wind speed, roughness of surface.
Air can be warm or cold, stable or unstable, But unstable air will have a deeper boundary lauer than stable air.

Surface wind speeds will be thus slower than the free-stream wind due to surface friction.    
Slowing the air reduces the Coriolis Force. As pressure gradient stays the same, the wind will turn toward the LOW.

Forces balance out as vector sum. PGF and CF in the free stream (windspeed perpendicular to PGF/CF and parallel to isobars). PGF vs friction and CF.

In the northern hemnisphere, the low pressure will be on the left.    
Thus, descending through boundary layer, the wind speed will reduce (free-stream --> friction layer) and wind direction will turn to the left.

southern hemnisphere: LOW to the right, wind turns to right.

surface friction at highest over land at night when air colder and denser
surface friction smallest during day when the air is warmer and less dense.

### Local Topographic Effects

Wind (and friction) dependent on topography. Winds follow the same physical laws as in the small scale aerodynamics.

* Valley winds - mountain barriers make winds flow down valleys, same like a venturi == the air converges, the pressure falls and the speed increases.

* mountain and valley breezes - local wind systems that blow downhill (mountain breeze) at night and uphill (valley breeze) during the day. At day, the thin air above high mountains sides warm quickly. Warm air rises and creates local low pressure along the slopes. Air from the lower valleyes moves in to replace it creating the upslope breeze. Strongerst around noon. (valley breeze)

At night, high mountain slopes cool quickly. Cold dense air forms a local HIGH pressure area. The pressure gradient drives a gentle breeze down the slop into the valley. Strongest just before sunrise = mountain breeze.

* Föhn Winds - warm dry winds that blow on the lee side of mountains. Moist stable air blows slowly over a grange of hills. Air will rise over the hills. Rised air cools and forms clouds. Being stable, slide down the other side where the cloud will end as the air warms up in the descent.    
If moisture was lost by precipitation on the hill, then the cloubase on the lee side will be higher than on the windward side. The longer warming at the DALR will give a higher surface temp on the lee side.

Föhn produces warm, dry winds in the lee of mountains.

* katabatic winds - katabatic == flowing down! sides of hills and mountains at night or on very cold days when there is no strong gradient wind to hide the effect. The cold surface cools the air by conduction. The colder and more dense air slides down the mountains.   
Katabatic winds can be quite strong as each parcel of descending air joins with others. (e.g. Mistral in Provence, Bora in the Alps toward North Adriatic ~ 70kt).

* anabatic winds - flow up the slides of mountains when the surface is hot during the day. The air in contact is heated by conduction. The less dense air slides up the hills. The heared air will tend to convect straight up rather than follow the slope of the mountain. Thus, anabatic winds only show in gentle gradient conditions flowing onto the slope. This wind is enhanced with the anabatic effect.

### Wind Hazards along hills.

* air rising up the hill and cooling at adiabatic lapse rates will rbing the zero degree isotherm lower on the windward side of the hill. This is combined with updraft and may produce moderate icing and turbulence on windward side
* airflow over the hill summit may induce lower pressures and make altimeter over-read.
* on the lee side of hills the warm Föhn wind may generate a temperature inversion over cold pools of air in the valleys;
* a cold katabatic flow undercutting warmer air will have a similar effect - inversion brings windshears, turbulence and performance degradation at top of cold layer.

### Land and Sea Breeze

land and sea breeze are light low level coastal winds that build up and decay throughout the day and night.    
They are caused by the land warming and cooling more quickly than the sea.    
They form in clear summer weather with a slack pressure gradient.
If there is a strong gradient wind already blowing, this will mask the effect.

sea breeze - day: land warms faster --> rises ~ LOW

land breeze - night

## Clouds

https://www.bom.gov.au/aviation/data/education/cloud-types-postcard.pdf

Classification of clouds based on appearance.    

stable air: "layered" ~ " stratus"     
unstable air: puffy and vertical extent ~ "cumulus"

Could type - stratus or cumulus - preceded by height at which they occur.
For temperate regions "low"  clouds range with a base below 6500ft (2000m) above GND ~ no prefix.   
cloudbase over 
- 6500ft < 16500ft (5000m): medium := "alto"
- > 16500ft (5000m): high ~ "cirro"

The prefix "nimbo" ~ rain bearing. Thus, nimbostratus is stratus cloud from wiht drizzle, rain or snow is falling.

These height ranges vary with latitude. For test ~ temperate latitudes.

Most clouds are confined wihtin their level with the following few notable exceptions:

* altostratus - typically middle level, but often extends higher
* nimbostratus ~ almost always in middle level, but can extend into the other two levels
* cumulus and cumulonimbus ~ typicl bass in low level, vertical extension is so great that their tops reach into middle or high level.


  Level / type          polar region    temperate reg   tropical region       
HIGH
- cirrus               3-8km            5-13km         6-18km
- cirrocumulos          10000-25000ft   16500-45000ft  20000-60000ft
- cirrostratus

MIDDLE
- altocumulus          2-4km            2-7km          2-8km
- altostratus          6500-13000ft     6500-23000ft   6500-25000ft
- nimbostratus

LOW     
- stratus              from earth's surface to 2km/2000m
- stratuscumulus                0 - 6500ft
- cumulos
- cumulonimbus

### High Clouds = cirro

cirro clouds typically contain ice crystals (rather than liquid water) ~ height ~ temperature   

flight conditions are good: no icing in cirrus (it is already ice) and it is not dense cloud --> reasonable visibility usually more than 1000m

Cirrus CI   
Detached clouds of white delivate, feathery or fibrous appearance, or white patches or bands.   
Appear to move without any significant change in form or shape.

Cirrostratos CS    
Transparent white veil, not thick enough to obscure the sun or moon. Sunlight passing through it is strong enough to form shadows on ground.    
ice crystal refract the light to produce haloes around the sun or moon.

cirrocumulus CC     
regular thin patches of high cloud without shadows; regular ripples or lumps.    
Most of the elements have an apparent width of less than one degree (small), [!?! the apparent width of a little finder held at arm's length.]

### Medium Level Clouds

clouds of water or of a mixture of water and ice particles.

Altocumulus AC     
one of more layers of cloud comprising lumps or rolls which are often more of less merged and coloured white or grey.

Altostratus AS     
Greyish or bluish cloud sheet or layer of striated, fibrous, or uniform appearance totally or partly covering the sky.    
Parts thin enough to reveal the sun - at least vaguely as though through ground glass.     
Light rain from thick altostratus may reach the ground.

### Low Level Clouds

Stratocumulus SC     
stratocumuls is - in general - grey or whitish in appearance. It may cover the sky completely or be patchy.    
It is composed of rounded masses or rolls, whcih may or may not merge. There are often aligned in waves.     
Though mainly formed by turbulence, it may also be formed as cumulus dies down and spreads out in the evening before dispersing.    
Turbulent stratocumulus can lead to moderate to severe icing conditions if the temperature are just below freezing.

Stratus ST     
Grey layer of cloud with fairly uniform base. 
Thick stratus may produce drizzle or snow grains.    
Thin stratus may form in moist air because of turbulence coupled with orographic lifting or surface cooling.    
Ragged patches of fracto-stratus may form in rain or snow falling from a layer of altostratus or nimbostratus above.

Nimbostratus NS     
Nimbostratus is a thick, grey layer of cloud, darker that either stratus or altostratus.    
Appearance is diffuse by more or less continuously falling rain or snow which typically reaches the ground.   
It is thick enough to block out the sun.     

Nimbostratus clouds are associated with frontal lifting and can be found with bases in the band for either low or medium level clouds.     
Nimbostratus can occur at any level from close to surface up to about 25000ft.

Cumulus CU     
detached heap cloud with sharp outline, particularly as it develops.   
Sunlit parts are brillantly white and the strength of the vertical motion inside the cloud can be inferred by observing the vigour of the rising domes or towers.    

In side larcter cumulus clouds - called towering cumulus - there are strong updrafts and consequently temperature in the cloud is warmer than the surrounding air.   

Development can be very lmimted on occasion resulting only in little puffy white clouds or may continue through a considerable depth leading to marked turbulence and icing.

Cumulonimbus CB     
The tops of cumulunimbos may reach very high levels, e.g. up to 30000ft over Europe, i.e., up to the tropopause and over 55000ft in the tropics where the sheer momentum of the stronger convective lifting can take the tops of these clouds into the lower stratosphere.

Cumulonimbus clouds show tremendous vigour and their tops become fibrous in appearance as ice particles predominate over water droplets.     
They are assocaited with showers, hail, and thunderstorms.    
Severe turbulence and severe icing is always to be expected in association with cumulunimbos clouds.


### Cloud shapes

cloud types can be further described by shape, if it is distinctive.   
Some more common definitions follow:

* fractus - clouds in the form of irregular or ragged shreds, borken cloud. The very low cloud ahead of the warm front is called fracto stratus which is found helow the frontal nimbo stratus in an aere of very high humidity receiving continuous steady rain.

* lenticularis - having the share of a conves lens or an almond. Altocumulus lenticularis are typically associated with mountain waves (or standing waves as air slopes over hill/mountain top).

* castellanus - usually applied to altocumulus describing the top of the cloud developing vertical extensions like the turrets of castles.

* capillatus - applied only to cumulunimbos clouds. The suffic capillatus implies cirrus elements in a layered or disorderly pattern often in the shape of an anvil. (latin: having "hair")

* mammatus - breast shaped cloudbase of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds associated with imminent precipitation.

### Types of CUmulus Clouds

* humile - cumulus clouds of only a small vertical extent
* mediocris - cumulus clouds of moderate vertical extent
* congestus - cumulus clouds with marked "sprouting" with fairly extensive vertical extent, resembles a cauliflower. Otherwise known as "towering cumulus".
* calcus - cumulonimbus that is losing some of its cumuliform shape in the upper parts. The top appears as withish mass with some vertical striations. Latin: "bald".

### Other Cloud Types

* nebulosus - like a layer or veil wiht no distinct details. Applies to Strotocumulus, altocumulus, and sometimes cirrocumulus
* fioccus - cirris, cirrocumulus and altocumumus with a tuft of cumuliform cloud that is ragged at the bottom. Ofen with virga which is an boservable streak or shaft of precipitation that falls from a cloud bu evaporates of sublimes before reaching the ground.
* fibratus - cirrus and ciffostratus that are very thin and detached streaks of cloud with no hooks at the ends or tufts.
* spissatus - cirrus clouds with sufficient thickness to appear grey.
* uncinus - cirrus clouds that are shaped like a comma. With a hook or tuft and a streak. Sometimes called mares'tail cirrus.


## Precipitation

precipitation := (out of clouds) rain, hail, or snow.    
precipitation depends on type of cloud, in particular the strength of updrafts within the cloud.

WMO definitions for precipitation:

### Drizzle

Drizzle DZ - fairly uniform precipitation of very fine drops of water ~ very small water droplets    
Drizzle drops less than 0.5mm in diameter. Drops almost "float", no noticeable impact on water surfaces.  
Drizzle falls from low stratus, sometimes touching ground, i.e., fog.

Identification of stratus cloud distinguishes rain from drizzle (stratus)

supercooled drizzle (freezing drizzle FZDZ): drizzle where temp drops below 0deg.   
Drops of supercooled drizzle may freeze on impact with ground, in-flight aircraft or other objects = "freezing drizzle".

### Rain

Rain RA: precipitation of drops of water that fall from cloud. Drops about 0.5-5.8 mm.    
Note: drops bigger of 5.8mm break up when falling because of the pressure from the airflow.

supercooled rain (freezing rain FZRA) - rain where temp drops below 0deg.    
Drops of supercooled rain may freeze on impact with ground, in-flight aircraft or other objects.

### Snow

Snow SN - precipitation composed of ice crystals, single or stuck together.

Form, size, and concentration of snow crystals (e.g. grains, needles, snowflakes) differ considerably according to the temperature and supersaturation at which they develop.   
Snow typically comprises various types of snow crystals and types.

Small droplets of frozen water are often attached to the snow crystals.    
If present in great numbers, these can obscure the crystalline struture of the snow.

At temps of about -5degrees, the crystals generally stick together to form snowflakes.

### Snow Grains SG

snow grains - small opatuye white particles of ice.   
Particles are fairly flat. Diameter of less than 1mm. 

Althgouh frozen and occurring when the temp is approx -10 < T < 0 degrees, the other properties of snow grain corresponds to drizzle.   
When hitting hard ground, no bouncing.

Snow grains fall mostly from Stratus of from fog, and never form a shower.   
Except for the mountains, snow grains usually fall in small quantities.

### Snow pellets GS

snow pellets - white and opaque ice particles. Generally conical or round, diameter up to 5 mm.    
Snow pellets are composed of a frozen nucleus covered with frozen cloud water droplets.   
They form when a particle of ice, collects cloud droplets which rapidly freeze.   
Density low, brittle.

Bounce on hitting ground and break.    
Showers of snow pellets fall from Cumulus or cumulunimbos. Showers usually consist of snow pellets and snowflakes together.   
Occur when temperatures near the surface are close to 0degC.

### Hail GR

hail GR - particles of ice (hailstones). can be transparent, of partly/completely opaque. usually spherical, conical, or irregular in form. Typically 5-50mm in diameter.    
Particles may fall from cloud either separately or agglomerated in irregular lumps.

Hail always occurs as shower. Typically during heave thunderstorms.   
Hail stones can cause significant damage.

Hailstones form around a nucleus that may not be at their geometric centre. The nulceaus may be anywhere between a few milimetres and a centimeter in diameter.
Nucleus composed of ice / usually opaque.

Hailstones can occur with great variety of forms and dimensions within a single shower.

### Small Hail (GS)

small hail - precipitation of translucent ice particles. Particles are almost always spherical and sometimes have conical tipis. Diameter may approach or exceed 5 mm.

Small hail always occurs in showers from Cumulonimbus.

Small hail consists of snow pellets totally or partially encased in a layer of ice.   
Smail hail not easily crushable (relative high density), bounces with audible sound from ground on impact.

Small hail is an intermediate stage between snow pellet and hailstone.    
Differs from snow pellet in its particularly smooth surface and higher density.    
Differs from hailstone in its smaller size.

### Ice Pellets (PL)

Ice pellets - precipitation of transparent ice particles. Spherical or irregular, and rarely conical. Diameter less than 5mm.   

Ice pellets originate as rain drops or snowflakes (less common) falling from Altostratus or Nimbostratus.   
They fall into a subcould layer of warm air where the snowflakes melt or partially melt, and then fall into a could layer of air (below 0deg) where they freeze and reach the ground as frozen precipitation.

Ice pellets are not easily crushable. Bounce with audible sound on impact.   

Ice pellets may be partly liquid. Their density is usually close to, or above that of ice (0.92 g/cm3)

### Ice Crystals (Diamond dust IC)

precipation from a clear sky as very small ice crystals - tiny.

Diamond dust can be observed in polar and alpine regions and continental interiors, especially in clearl, calm, and cold weather.    
It forms at temperatures typically less than -10decC in rapidly cooling airmass.     
crystals of about 100um.    

Crystals - when visible - sparkle in sunlight and can produce halo pheonomena.    
Visibility in diamond dust varies considerably, and the lower limit is greater than 1 km.

### condensation nuclei

Water vapour requires something to condense on to, called condensation nuclei. 
A condensation nuclei is typically smoke, dust, and ice or salt crystals.   

Super saturated air ~ water vapour saturation can go beyond 100%.
Relative humidities in escess of 400% have been reached in labs.

Nuclei are hygroscopic - like ice crystals. They attract the water vapour, and condensation can occur before saturation is reached.   
This is explains why sometimes mist and fog form with RH below 100%.

### Drizzle and Rain

Two theories why water droplets or ice grow inside clouds. Neither gives complete answer.

**Theory A: Ice Crystal Theory - Wegener-Bergereon-Findeisen - Norwegian Theory**      
water is known to exist as a liquid below 0degC when it is supercooled.   
Such water droplets can be mixed with ice crystals in cloud above the freezing level.    
If the air is still rising and water vapour is continuing to condense, it will tend to sublimate directly onto the nucleus of an ice crystal. Water vapour over ice is lower than that over water (~ attracts).   

Question: water vapour pressure is higher around liquid water droplet than around ice crystal ==> difference of maximum vapour pressure over water and over ice of the same temperature.

The crystal grows until a point at which they cannot be supported by the existing updraft ==> fall.   
During fall the crystal grows by colliding with other ice crystals.  
When reaching surface they will be snow (conglomeration of ice crystals up to 5mm in diameter), snow grain (up to 1 mm diameter) or diamond dust (tiny ice crystals) depending on the rate of collision of the ice crystals during the descent through the cloud.    
Below the freezing level, the crystals melt and turn into rain.


**Theory B: Coalescence Theory of Precipitation**    
Liquid drops grow in size because they collide and coalsce with other drops.   
If an updaraft is supporting drops of various sizes, the smaller ones will move up faster than the larger ones (heavier) and therefore they will collide.     
When the size of the combined drop is too large to be supported, it will fall and bump into other drops and growing further.    

This theory explains the creation of rain and drizzle.
Coalescence can produce drizzle and rain at _all_ latitudes in both stratus and cumulus clouds.
Drizzle (small drops) most common for Stratus / cumulus "big drops"

QUESTION: in mid latitudes, coalescence explains the production of "only drizzle and very light rain".


Theory A explains why rain does not fall from cumulus cloud until the cloud tops have passed the freezing level (in temperate climates). In the tropics, however, and in strats clouds, rain falls from cloud where the temperature is +5degC or more. There are suggestions that small particles like dust may take the place of ice crystals and the condensation nuclei.   
The seeding of cumulus clouds with silver iodide crystals does sometimes produce rain. This supports the nuclei theory.

Theory B seems to explain the formation of raindrops in stratus cloud at temperatures above freezing. 

In reality it may be a combination of both.

### Snow

snow is precipation in form of ice crystals forming above 0degC level in the cloud.    
As the ice crystal fall, they are warmed by the higher air temperatures below.
If their temperture raises to zero, they will begin to melt.    
Meting requires an input of latent energy drawn from the surrounding air.   
The air termperature will fall and the 0degClevel will be lower in the snowfall than in the air outside.   
If the snow has to fall through more than abotu 1500ft of air above 0degC, it will melt completely and reach the ground as rain. This equates to a ground level temperature of 3-4 degC.

The ICAO definitions are as follows:

* **slush** - water saturated snow which with a heel-and-toe slap-down motin against the ground will be dispaced with a spatter, specific gravity: 0.5-0.8. (?!?!)

* **dry snow** - snow which can be blown if loose, or - if compacted by hand - will fall apart again upon release; specific gravity: up to 0.35 (not included)

* **wet snow** - snow which - if compacted by hand - will stick together and tend to form a snowball; specific gravity 0.35 up to but not includeing 0.5.

* **compact snow** - snow which has been compressed into a solid mass that resists further compression and will hold together or break up into lumps, if picked up; specific gravity 0.5 and over.

### Hail

Hail is assocaited only with cumulonimbus clouds.   

The updrafts in these clouds are very strong and it is possible for an ice crystal at the top of the cloud to fall, gathering moisture around it as it falls, be lifted up again by the updrafts, and so on.   
Crystal is refrozen as a larger lump of ice, before falling.

A large hailstone will show rings of similar to the rings in a tree trunk. Each corrsponding to a falling and rising cycel within the highly convective cloud.   
Hailstone will fall to ground when too heavy or when the updraft through the hailstone away fromt he top of the cloud.

Hail has been observed in clear air several miles away from the parent thunderstorm and although hailstones are typically only a few mm in diameter.
Example of hailstone: 150mm ~ 1kg.

The largest hailstones can be found in cumulunimbus clouds over continental interiors rather than sea
Convective and orographic triggers will be stronger over land.   
Freezing levels are high in equatorial regions (about 16000ft): hailstones do not reach - typically - the ground in these areas.

In temperate latitudes, hail can damage aircraft.   
Encountered as high as 45000ft.    
Hailstones of 100mm in diameter have been encountered at 10000ft in severe thunderstomrms. (photo from B737 - badly damaged nose)



## Standing Waves - Mountain Waves

Standing waves = mountain waves occur in the troposphere when stable air mass blows at moderate speed over a range of hills or mountains.   
Turbulence above that extends into low stratosphere.    
However - safety hazard - turbulence and downdrafts near surface.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/met-mountain-wave.png")
#source:  JAA MET Fig 9.5
```

* wind of 15kt or more over small mountains, up to 30kt or move over large mountains
* wind speed increasing steadily with height up to tropopause
* wind direction roughly constant up to tropopause
* wind direction within 30 degrees of the perpendicular to the ridge line
* stable air mass      
  strongest waves, if there is a very strong stable layer, possibly inversion at ridge height with less stable air (but not unstable) above and below
  
good visual detection: cap cloud on montain tops, lenticular clouds "downstream", beware of rotor clouds (if visible)

If conditions are met: air mass forms stable **wave pattern**.    
Area of strongest turbulence is about at ridge height and "1" wavelength downwind (rotor).    
The wavelength depends on the windspeed and ridge height. In Europe, typically 5-10NM.

A Föhn wind over the Alps creates turbulence on the far side of the mountains.

### Rotor Streaming

During the first peak, the wave formation may be strong enough to create a **horizontal rotor**. The rotating air will create a roll cloud if the humidity is high enough.    
The "Helm Bar" of Cross Fell in UK is a well know example of this effect. (?!?)

Turbulence in rotors is severe.   
Sometimes the rotors break off and stream away downwind carrying their turbulence with them.     
Note: rotors and rotor streaming can occur in the lee of ridges even when the upper air condistions are not right for standing wave formation.

FLying with the wind over the ridge itself produces no serious problems.   
Flying into the wind require to climb to clear the ridge when the downdraft is forcing you down.   
Potential hazard for all aircraft, escpecially light aircraft.

Turbulence behind hills, rotors and rotor streaming are not confined to standing wave coditions.   
They can occur in any strong wind over hills conditions.

### Other visual clues

major visual clues: 
* cap cloud over the ridge and
* lens shaped - lenticular - clouds "downstream" wherever there is a layer of moist air aloft that is cooled belw the dew point in the rising part of the wave.

Turbulence from standing/mountain waves up into the low stratosphere.
As moderate low level wind steadily increases with height, standing waves are often associated with jetstreams aloft.    
The wave effects can persist for up to 100NM downwind (dependend on mountain size and windspeed).


## Visibility

Day or night, visibility reduced when particles in the atmosphere obstructed, reflect, and scatter the light.    
Particles could be: water droplets, ice crystals, or solids (e.g. sand, dust, smoke)

Additional icing on windshield, sun reflecting from top of clouds, fog, and haze layers or looking into the sun can reduce flight visibility.

### Hazards

poor visibility during landing and take-off --> difficulty to see runway, angle of approach     
confusion: "closer to runway/tourchdown or at higher appraoch angle"

### Defining visibility

flight and aerodrome visibility are often different. E.g. mist layer at ground vs from air.

Aerodrome visibility := prevailing visibility or runway visual range RVR

ICAO Annex 3:

**Visibility** for aeronautical purposes is the greater of:    
1. greatest safe distance at which a black object of suitable dimensions situatated near the ground can be seen and recognised when observed agains a bright background, and
2. greatest distance at which lights in the vicinity of 1000 candelas can be seen and identified against an unlit black background.


**ground visibility** is defined as the prevailing visibility near the Earth's surface as reported by an accredited observer.

**prevailing visibility** the visibility value that is reached of exceeded within at least half the horizon circle or within at least half of the surface of the aerodrome. These areas could comprise contiguous or non-contiguous sectors.

### prevailing visibility ~ average visibility.

caveats:
* half horizon --> visibility in one or more directions is significantly lower than the prevailing visibility
* vis in any direction less than prevailing visibility and less than 1500m or less than 50% of prevailing visibility and less than 5000m, the lowest visibility observed will be also reported.
* general direction of the are of lower visibility will be indivated by reference to one of the eight points on the compass. If lowest visibility is observed in more than one direction, the most operationally significant direction will be reported.
* when visibility is fluctuating rapidly, the prevailing visibility cannot be determined. Only the lowest visibility will be reported with no indication of direction.

Note: non-precision or circle-to-land approach is based on prevailing visibility. Thus visiubilty in certain sectors could be less than 50% of the reported visibility, but the minimum value will be reported if less than 1500m

Prevailing visibility reported in meters.     
METAR EGGD 1250 1800 0800NE ...     
Weather at 1250, ("prevailing") visibility 1800 meters, ("worst") visibility 800 meteres to the North East.

### Runway Visual Range (RVR)

RVR is the maximum distance in the directio of takeoff or landing at wich the runway, or specified lights delineating the runway, can be soon from a position on the centreline corresponding to the average eye level of a pilot at touchdown.

RVR may be assessed subjectively by observer, but is typically measured automatically (infra-red or laser sensors).    
RVR sensors are called "transmissionmeters", other sensor: "forward scatter meter" measuring visibility by looking at the amoutn by which solid particles or water groplets in the atmosphere are scattering light.


Methods for measuring **prevailing visibility** and **RVR** are quite different.    
RVR is measured in a specific direction if less than 1500m.    
Prevailing visibility will be the average and the minimum values.

RVR and prevailing visibility can not be directly compared.     
RVR is likely to be the same as or greater that the lowest reported value of the prevailing visibility.

### RVR reporting

RVR reporting in steps of 25m up to 200m, then in 50m up to 800m, then in steps of 100m.    
RVR is - normally - not reported, if it is 1500m or more.

Most automatic systems report touchdown, midpoint, and stop end values.   
Partly surpressed to cut down chatter on final approach frequency if not significant.

E.g. AGIVIS (commonly used system in Europe): mid-point or stop end values are repored only if the value in question is less than the touchdown value AND less than 800m, or if it is less than 400m.    
When all three values are given, the names are omitted.

### Low Visibility Conditions

* fog is caused by water droplets or ice crystals - visibility less than 1000m, RH 100%
* mist caused by water droplets or ice crystals - visibility at least 1000m but not more than 5000m, RH assumed 95%
* freezing fog is fog in termperature below 0degC and consists aminly of supercooled water droplets
* ice fog consists of ice crystals (rather than water droplets) - extremely rare / mostly in polar regions; temp below -20degC
* haze consists of solid particles, if visibility less than 1000m, qualified by type of pollution, e.g. smoke haze.
* blowing snow = snow, temp below 0degC, picked up by strong surface winds

The type of obscuration - mist or haze, smoke, dust or sand - is NOT normally quoted, if the visibility is more than 5000m.

### Radiation Fog

Radiation Fog forms when surface cools at night through long wave radiation (loss of heat energy). The cold surface cools the air in contact by conduction bringing it below the dew point.    

c.f. above: sea surface does not cool significantly at night. Ground / solid does!
Radiation fog only occurs over land., away from the coast, and the moderating influence of the sea, and usually when there is little or no cloud cover (== stronger cooling / no obstructions) to limit temperature reduction.

Industrial contamination increases the probablity of fog formation by providing nulei for condensation.

In still air, the cooling by conduction will be limited to a very thin layer of air near the surface ==> water condensing out == heavy dew == no fog.     
In strong(er) winds, the turbulent mixing will lift the fog into low cloud or disperse it.

Conditions favouring radiation fog:

* over land
* at night (cooling)
* clear or nearly clear skies (no shield/damping of cooling effect)
* light winds - 2-8kt
* high relative humidity.

Typical conditions of high pressure systems in winter and in cool high perssure systems in the summer with a slack pressure gradient and low level termperature inversion holding moisture below it.

Low lying areas inland where katabatic winds have brought lower tempeatures and with marshy or damp ground.

Radiation fog typically only up to 500ft thick.

Radiation fog forms (typically) in dawn.

If temp below 0degC - air will meet frost point first as it cools. Moisture --> ice (sublimation) == heavy frost rather than radiation fog.     
Can turn into (heavy)fog with slight turbulence and heating at sunrise.

Radiation fog is cleared by surface heating during the day. 
More quickly during summer.
Or by strong winds or a change of air mass.


#### Southern Gulf in Winter

southern arabian gulf is directly beneath the sub-tropical high perssure system, with light winds and clear skies at night.    
Temp fall over the dessert can be quite severe.   
During day, sea breezes bring in cool moist air over coastal regions.  
At night, the temp fall over land catches the moist air before the night time land breezes take it out to the sea.      
==> radiation fog forms in coastal areas and gently drifts out to the sea.    
Fog burns off in the hot sun shortly after sunrise.

#### Polor Maritime Air in Winter

polar maritime air originated in cold polar areas and passed over warmer ocean surface. --> moist air    
As (moist) air warms, it rises and gets unstable.   
The weather normally associated: convective cloud and vood visibility, except in sowers.

If polor maritime air lies over land in winter, the convective activity may die away at night leaving a cool stable moist air mass with clear skies.   
If there are light winds, this sets up all the conditions for radiation fog.


### Advection Fog

Advection fog occurs when warm moist air masses move over a cold surface.      
**Katty Perry "katvection" = hot and cold**
About 15kt windspeed is needed to move the air mass.

Typically, warm air from sub-tropical high pressure regions flowing toward polor front zone, and meeting cold ocean current coming in from the poles.     

Unlike radiation fog, which can form over land at night, advection fog can form over land or sea, day or night.

Advectio fog formed over the sea can persist when blown onshore, if the land is cold (usually in winter).
Warm winds blowing over cold ground can also form advetion fog. Particular, melting snow that covers the ground ~ "thaw fog".

high winds can lift advection fog into the low stratus or clear it by turbulent mixing.    
Ditto, daytime heating can lift or dispense the fog over land.

Advection fog forms rapidly when the airmass conditions are right and may only clear again when the airmass conditions change.

### Arctic Smoke

artic smoke or sea smoke or steaming fog has the reverse mechanism from advection fog.

It is formed when (very) cold (polar) air passes over a warm surface.  
Often when (very) cold air flows over (relatively) warm water.

Normally, these conditions, i.) moisture and ii.) heating from below, would produce instability and convection in the air mass.     
Thus, there has to be a marked temperature inversion at low level to prevent the lifting.

Arctic smoke is often seen in Greenland and Norwegian fjords.   
Arctic smoke GND to 500ft maximum.

### Frontal or Other Types of Fog

Frontal fog is fog associated with the passage of a warm front.   
It can be hill fog, thaw fog, or a type of very low stratus cloud formed in the continuous rain at frontal passage.

Cold saturated air ahead of a warm front mising with the warm moist air behind the front.    
--> sometimes called: (front) mixing fog.

### Fog Characteristics - Summary

Fog is cloud - usually stratus - in contact with the ground or sea and visibility of less than 1000m.

Fog formation --> fog forms by increasing moisture and /or cooling the air. Moisture is increased by the following:
* precipitation
* evaporation from wet surfaces
* moisture advection

Cooling of the air results from
* radiation cooling
* advection over cold surface
* upslop flow
* evaporation

Dissipation

removing moisture and/or heating the air dissipates fog and stratus.    
Moisture is decreased by
* turbulent transfer of moisture downward to the surface (e.g. to for dew or frost)
* turbulent mixing of the fog layer with adjavent drier air
* advection of drier air
* condensation of the eater vapour to clouds.

Heating of the air results from
* turbulent transport of heat upward from air in contact with warm gound
* advection of warmer air
* transport of air over warmer land surfaces
* adiabatic warming of air through subsidence or downslope motion
* turbulent mixing of the fog layer with adjacent warmer air aloft
* release of latent heat associated with the formation of clouds.

## Pressure Systems - Convergence and Divergence

Divergence = net outflow of air (decrease of mass) in an area
convergence = net inflow or air (increase of mass) in an area

In active pressure systems, the pressure pattens at the surface and at the tropopause are opposity.    
surface LOW  (convergence) --> rising air (convection) --> divergence in upper air.
surface HIGH (divergence)  <-- sinking air (subsidience) <-- convergence LOW in upper air.

Note: level of "non-divergence" ~ 600 hPa ~ 14000ft := "barometric level".
At barometric level, the pressure systems are neither HIGH nor LOW, but between the two.    
Over poles, barometric level can be 10000ft/700hPa; higher near equator.

18.000ft ~ 500 hPa

Highs or Anticyclones - high pressure systems are called anticyclones.   
Air flows out of a high pressure system (geostrophic rules) clockwise. (clock Northern Hemnisphere/opposite in the Southern)
((NH: LeftHand - thumb up/HIGH --> clockwise, thumb down/LOW --> counter-clockwise))

![divergence and convergence](figures/met-divergence-convergence.png)

Think about subscael on your altimeter:

* Norther Hemnisphere: turn it left (anti-clockwise) --> indicated altitude decreases = LOW
* NH: same with crosswind from left (anti-clockwise wind direction) --> alt decrease = LOW

NH: wind from left = altitude theft

NH: HIGH ~ Hour = clockwise     
NH: LOW  ~ anti-clockwise

```

Anticyclones    
* large ~ 1500NM
* slow to form and dissipate
* slow moving / stationary
* surface pressure gradient at centre is low == light winds

### Cyclones - Lows - Depressions

Cyclone - air moves in same direction as Earth's rotation ~ **counter-clockwise**/Northern Hemisphere.

Cyclones     
* (relatively) small ~ 300NM  
* active, form rapidly, move at fair speeds, and fill rapidly when dying.

Mechanism for taking in energy at low level in the form of latent heat or warm air, carrying it alogt.   
This energy input, translated to kinetic energy -- winds -- makes the LOW circulate more strongly, further lowering the central pressure (and sucking in more energy).    
Depression/LOW will continue to develop and deepend until the energy feed is cut off or the upply of warm air runs out --> die.   
Depressions are associated with strong winds, surface convergence, upper divergence, convection and precipitation.    

Depressions/LOWs classified according to how they form:

* frontal depression/low - formed along the line of the polar front
* orographic depression/low - "lee depression" formed by swirling of airflow behind hills and mountains
* thermal depression/low - caused by surface heating
* cold air low/polar low - associated with small-scale instability developing in polar airflow.

### Ridges, Troughs, and Cols

ridge (or wedge) - elongated area of relatively high pressure - characterised by a generally anticyclonic weather (fair weather), extension of HIGH pressure region, bounded by LOW pressure.

troughs - elongated area of LOW pressure system, sharp kkink/angle in "v"-shaped isobars.   
Troughs often coincide with fronts, across which wind direction and isobar alignment change.    
Typically associated with unsettled weather, cloudy conditions, precipitation, and often produce lines of convective cloud and thunderstorms in conditionally or absolutely unstable air masses.

cols - like geographic cols - are regions between two highs and two lows.   
Pressure pattern produces basically no low level wind.   
Light winds, clear skies, and an inversion at low level.   
Over land in winter: cols can produce deteriorating visibility due to radiation fog.    
Over land in summer: lack of wind and turbulance allows the surface heating to raise the low level air temperature to the point where convective activity starts ==> "air mass thunderstorms", isolated, thermally generated CBs 





## Formulae - Questions - check where to integrate

$$RH = 100 - 5* (T - T_d)$$
Temp: 21 deg, dew point: 9 deg ==> spread = 21-9 = 12 deg
RH = 100 - 5 * 12 = 100 - 60 = 40

T = 30, td = 21 ==> spread = 9
RH = 100 - 5* 9 = 100 -45 = 55%



Temp correction (warmer than isa, distance higher)

Fl190 - FL070 = 12 000ft
4% per 10degC ==> 2% per 5degC ==> 2% 0f 12000 = 240ft
distance 12000ft +240ft = 12240ft


## Standard Atmosphere

for every 1degC deviation from standard temperature, altitude change by 4ft per 1000ft

4ft * 10deg * 2(1000ft) = 80ft

## Cloud

$$cloud\ base = 400 * (surface\ temp - dew\ point)$$

Some questions

- sample of moist but unsaturated air may become saturated 
... by expanding it adiabatically - adiabatic cooling increases RH

- QFE, QNH, and QFF are the same
... airport at MSL

surface temp is 15C, temp 1t 10000ft in a current of acending unsaturated air is
... ascending unsaturated air will cool at DALR = 3C/1000ft --> 15C - (10 * 3) = -15C



conditions to formation of steam fog
...  cold air to warm surface = advection cooling == steaming fog
  vs warm air to cold surface = advection warming == advection fog
 
 advection fog ~ warm moist air to cold surface
 frontal fog ~ warm moist air to cold (humid) air
 additional moist --> warm front
  
  
check questions on ISA temp ==> density or density altitude     
... lower temperature than ISA --> higher air density --> lower density altitude

ISA at 18000ft: 15 - (18 * 2) = 15 - 36 = -21C
OAT := - 35C    
--> actual outside temperature is LOWER than ISA, thus DENSITY is HIGHER


Sinking air ...
... is heated by compression (air gets denser, warms) = adiabatic heating     
==> can hold more water vapour == less cloud



which form of precipitation falls from clouds containing only water ...
... "only water" = Nimbostratus == drizzle    
note: large raindrops and hail ~ large cumulus containing both: water droplets and ice crystals.







## See How to integrate the following

Humidity
Cloud formation occurs when invisible water vapour becomes visible, either as water droplets or ice crystals.  This is called condensation.  When ice crystals form, the process is sublimation.

Every air mass is limited in the amount of moisture it can hold; when this limit is reached—referred to as the saturation point—condensation will occur.

The amount of moisture an air mass can hold is dependent on temperature: the warmer the air, the more moisture it can hold.

Relative Humidity is the ratio of water vapour in the air relative to the saturation point (saturated air has 100% RH).  As air is cooled its ability to hold invisible moisture decreases; the temperature to which unsaturated air must be cooled to become saturated (at constant pressure and humidity) is called the dewpoint.  The smaller the spread between temperature and dewpoint, the higher the relative humidity.  Fog or cloud usually forms when the spread is within 2°C.

Supercooled Water Droplets: Water droplets can remain in a water state as low as -40°C., and are commonly found in cloud with temperatures between 0° and -15°C.  When these droplets strike an airframe, severe icing can occur.

Heating
The troposphere is heated from below from the earth’s surface by radiation (terrestrial radiation).  Specifically, we identify four processes:

convection

Air over warm surfaces becomes heated and rises; cold air descends to replace it

advection

Cold air becomes heated after moving over a warm surface.

compression

Descending air is compressed and its temperature rises.

turbulence

The mixing process whereby heat is distributed.

Isotherms are found on meteorological maps and are lines joining areas of equal temperature.

Cooling
Since the troposphere is heated from below, temperature decreases with increased altitude; the rate of decrease is called the lapse rate.  The lapse rate is 2°C. per 1000’ (specifically, 1.98°C).

The earth’s surface cools at night as heat is lost by radiation—radiation cooling.  When warm air moves over a cool surface, the decreased temperature of the air is advection cooling.  As air rises, it expands and cools; this is called the adiabatic process.  Two adiabatic lapse rates are used: the dry adiabatic lapse rate, which is 3°C. per 1000’, and the saturated adiabatic lapse rate, which is 1.5°C. per 1000 ft.

Using the dry adiabatic lapse rate, cloud bases can be predicted; icing levels can be predicted by the saturated adiabatic lapse rate.  To make the calculation, you require surface temperature and dew point; take the temperature-dewpoint spread and divide by 3 for predicting cloud heights in thousands of feet or by 1.5 to predict freezing level.

Stability
It is useful to differentiate between two types of air masses: stable and unstable.
Stability of an air mass refers to its tendency to develop vertical movement (updrafts and downdrafts).
Stable air resists vertical movement, and when displaced returns to its original horizontal level; unstable air moves further up and down when disturbed.
Why is this important?  Unstable air produces turbulence and thunderstorms.
When expansion of air takes place, the air is cooled.  This is the adiabatic process.
If the rising air cools to a temperature equal to its surrounding air, stability will occur and it will stop rising; if, however, the rising air remains warmer than the surrounding air, it will continue to rise.
The main indicator of air stability is therefore the temperature lapse rate.  Rule:  A steep lapse rate creates instability, and a shallow lapse rate creates stability.
Advection therefore causes a steepening of the lapse rate and creates instability, while an isothermal layer (layer with constant vertical temperature) or an inversion (reversed lapse rate) causes stability.
Lifting agents which create vertical movement of air:
Convection: air heated by warm surface; an example of this is the evenly spaced puffy clouds that form on a previously clear summer’s day.
Orographic lift: air forced to rise because of terrain; this is why the folks in North Vancouver have so much rain; it is also why folks on the West Coast have rain and the Prairie folks do not.
Frontal lift: cold air undercutting warm air, or warm air overrunning cold air.
Mechanical turbulence: friction between wind and surface.
Convergence: air moving to the centre of a low pressure, which fills the area and is forced to rise.
