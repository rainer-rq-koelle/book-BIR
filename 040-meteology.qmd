relative humidity

$$RH = 100 - 5* (T - T_d)$$
Temp: 21 deg, dew point: 9 deg ==> spread = 21-9 = 12 deg
RH = 100 - 5 * 12 = 100 - 60 = 40

T = 30, td = 21 ==> spread = 9
RH = 100 - 5* 9 = 100 -45 = 55%

Temp correction (warmer than isa, distance higher)

Fl190 - FL070 = 12 000ft
4% per 10degC ==> 2% per 5degC ==> 2% 0f 12000 = 240ft
distance 12000ft +240ft = 12240ft


## Standard Atmosphere

for every 1degC deviation from standard temperature, altitude change by 4ft per 1000ft

4ft * 10deg * 2(1000ft) = 80ft

## Cloud

$$cloud\ base = 400 * (surface\ temp - dew\ point)$$





Wind direction

mnenomic: "like in a fight, NO BACKING Down"
aircraft in 2000ft Warsaw,  wind 210 /24kt
Northern Heminisphere = NO
BACK =210 -30 = 180
DOWN = 50% --> 12kt


Divergence = net outflow of air (decrease of mass) in an area
convergence = net inflow or air (increase of mass) in an area

Think about subscael on your altimeter:

* Norther Hemnisphere: turn it left (anti-clockwise) --> indicated altitude decreases = LOW
* NH: same with crosswind from left (anti-clockwise wind direction) --> alt decrease = LOW

NH: wind from left = altitude theft

NH: HIGH ~ Hour = clockwise     
NH: LOW  ~ anti-clockwise
