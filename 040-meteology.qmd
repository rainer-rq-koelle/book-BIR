Forces that drive the weather system.

## The Atmosphere

The atmosphere is a mixture of gases, including water vapour, solid particles (e.g. Dust and smoke), and some water in either solid of liquid form (e.g. clouds, mist, fog).

Composition of dry air (no water/water vapour, and solids), the concentrations of gases are constant in the lower layer of the atmosphere (i.e., troposphere):

* Nitrogen $N_2$: 78%
* Oxygen $O_2$: 21%
* Argon $AR$: 0.9% with traces of Carbon Dioxide $CO_2$ and other gases.

These are relative percentages by volume in dry air.   
Most gases are inert as far as the weather is concerned, carrying only limited amounts of energy as hot or cold air.    
The three that play an important part are the very small percentages of Carbon Dioxide, Ozone, and water vapour.

Water vapour carries the large amount of **latent (heat) energy**. It is a light transparent gas.
It averages less than 1% by volume, with the local concentration of water vapour varying significantly from 0.001% in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to about 4% in hot and humid air masses.    
Most of the water vapour in the atmosphere is found at low altitudes and in areas with higher air temperature, i.e., the tropics.

The sun's energy reaches the earth as short wave radiation, and little is absored or reflected before it warms the earth's surface.   
Long wave readiation is then emitted back into the atmosphere from below/the surface.
Some of this long wave radiation is absorbed by the carbon dioxide and water vapour.
This absorption is causing the ***greenhouse gas effect***.

Ozone, an allotrope of oxygen made of 3 oxygen atoms rather than the usual two, is most concentrated in a layer in the upper stratosphere between 50 000 and 100 000ft (15 to 30 km).     
Ozone absorbs harmful UV radiation from the sun. As the UV radiation is absorbed it causes a temperature increase in the upper atmosphere. The maximum heating occurs at the top of the ozone layer ~ 160 000ft (50km).

### Pressure and Density

In the atmosphere, there is a fixed relationship between temperature, pressure, and volume.    
The general gas law is

$$Pressure * Volume = R * Temperature$$
$R$ a gas constant.    
In meteorology we are most concerned with the **density** of the air/atmosphere.

Density is defined as the mass of a unit volume of a gas, for a fixed mass of air, density is inversely proportional to volume.    
This means that as the volume increases, the density decreases.

$$\frac{1}{Volume} = \frac{Pressure}{R * Temperture}$$
Substituting $Density ~ \frac{1}{Volume}$ 
$$Density \alpha \frac{Pressure}{R * Temperature}$$
Thus, density is directly proportional to pressure, and inversely proportional to Temperature.

$$Density \alpha \frac{Pressure}{Temperature}$$

relative humidity

$$RH = 100 - 5* (T - T_d)$$
Temp: 21 deg, dew point: 9 deg ==> spread = 21-9 = 12 deg
RH = 100 - 5 * 12 = 100 - 60 = 40

T = 30, td = 21 ==> spread = 9
RH = 100 - 5* 9 = 100 -45 = 55%

Temp correction (warmer than isa, distance higher)

Fl190 - FL070 = 12 000ft
4% per 10degC ==> 2% per 5degC ==> 2% 0f 12000 = 240ft
distance 12000ft +240ft = 12240ft


## Standard Atmosphere

for every 1degC deviation from standard temperature, altitude change by 4ft per 1000ft

4ft * 10deg * 2(1000ft) = 80ft

## Cloud

$$cloud\ base = 400 * (surface\ temp - dew\ point)$$





Wind direction

mnenomic: "like in a fight, NO BACKING Down"
aircraft in 2000ft Warsaw,  wind 210 /24kt
Northern Heminisphere = NO
BACK =210 -30 = 180
DOWN = 50% --> 12kt


Divergence = net outflow of air (decrease of mass) in an area
convergence = net inflow or air (increase of mass) in an area

Think about subscael on your altimeter:

* Norther Hemnisphere: turn it left (anti-clockwise) --> indicated altitude decreases = LOW
* NH: same with crosswind from left (anti-clockwise wind direction) --> alt decrease = LOW

NH: wind from left = altitude theft

NH: HIGH ~ Hour = clockwise     
NH: LOW  ~ anti-clockwise
