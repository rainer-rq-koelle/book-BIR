title: "Flight Planning and Monitoring"
---

Flight Planning broadly covers 

* route planning for IFR flights
* fuel planning
* planning to cover emergencies
* flight monitoring


fuel planning is essential & critical.     
Fuel is a significant portion of operator's overall costs.


## Key Terms and Definitions

### Navigation

**wind correction angle WCA** := amount and direction by which the heading is offset from the course in order to allow for wind velocity/direction

**track (Tr) or course (Co)** := path over the surface of the earth

**drift** := the angle between heading and track

**true airspeed (TAS)** speed of the aeroprolane through the atmosphere

**nautical miles (NAM/NM)** air distance flown in a given time at a given TAS

**nautical ground miles NGM** ground distance covered over the earths' surface

**ground speed (GS)** speed of the aeroplane over the earth's surface

**TOC** top of climb
**TOD** top of descent

### Route Terminology

**route** := a description of the path followed by an aeroplane between a departure point and its nominated final destination.

**route segment** := a portion of a route, usually between nominated points that are generally coincident with significant waypoints.

**schedule** one of a number of regular flights along a nominated route.

**waypoint** significant navigation point alon the route normally definedas a latitude/longitude or as a VOR/DME radial and range.

### ALtitudes

**Minimum Safe En Route IFR Altitude (MEA)** = lowest published altitude (between radio fixes) that meets obstacle clearance requirements between these fixes. The MEA applies to the entire width of the airway, segment or route between the defining radio fixes.     
In many countries: MEA ensures acceptable radio navigational signal coverage.

**Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitude (MOCA)** = lowest published altitude in effect between radio fixes on VOR airways, off airways routes, or route segments meeting obstacle clearance rewquirements for the entire route segment (and in the US: sufficient radio nav signal coverage within 22NM of a VOR).    
--> 100ft clearance over obstacles up to and including 6000ft and 2000ft clearance for obstacles over 6000ft in elevation.    
Indicated on en-route chart with T suffix to the minimum, e.g. 5300T

**Minimum Safe (Sector) Altitude (MSA)** = MSA given on instrument approach charts. MSA identifies the minimum altitude that provides a 1000ft vertical clearance above obstacles within 25NM of navigational facility.    
Could be divided into sectors with different values.    
MSA is for emergency use only.

**Minimum Off Route Altitude (MORA)**    
* ROUTE MORA provides a defined vertical clearance above all obstructions within 10NM of the route rentre line.    
* GRID MORA provides a minimum of 1000ft clearance in a section defined by latitude and longitude lines

**Maximum Authorised Altitude (MAA)** = published altitude that represents the maximum useable altitude or flight level for a particular airspace structure or route segment.

**Minimum Crossing ALtitude (MCA)** = lowest altitude at which an aircraft proveeding in the direction of a higher MEA may cross a certain fix.

**Minimum Holding Altitude (MHA)** = lowest altitude in a holding pattern that assures navigational signal coverage, communications, and provides clearance of at least 1000ft above obstracles in the holding area.   
Over high terrain or in mountainous areas, additional obstacle clearance up to 600m (1969ft) is provided to accommodate effects of turbulence, down dafts, and other meteorological phenomena on the performance of altimeters.

### Fuel Terminology

**Start-Up and Taxy** = fuel allowance - often fixed by the operator - which has to be deducted from Ramp (Taxy) Mass to obtain Take-off Mass (TOM).

**Take-Off, Climb, Cruise, and Descent Fuels** -> values extracted from the performance manual to meet the needs of the particular route, weather, and operating profile.

**Trip Fuel** or **Sector Fuel** = sum of take-off, climb, cruise, and descent, approach and landing fuels, or runawy to runway.

**Contingency Fuel** = fuel amount carried to account for unplanned operations, e.g. ATC re-routing, cruising at lower flight level, stranger than forecasrt headwinds.

**Alternate Fuel** = fuel required from the missed approach point to the nomnated alternate. It will include the fuel required for climb, cruise, descent, approach, and landing.

**Additional Fuel (for planning purposes)** = fuel that may be required for planning purposes or contingencies (depressuraisation is one example).

**Island Reserve** operations to isolated airfields or islands require a significantly increased reserve fuel on arrival at destination.

**Final Reserve** = quantity of fuel that should never be used, but is carried in order to provide a safety net.   
You should always land - at destination and alternate - with *final reserve fuel intact*.    
Final reserve fuel for    
- turbine engine: 30 minutes holding at 1500ft above airfield
- piston engine: 45 min fuel (normally at cruise fuel flow).

**Block Fuel** or **Ramp Fuel** = total fuel loaded into the aeroplance = sum of    
* taxy fuel
* trip fuel
* reserve fuel consisting of
  + contingency fuel
  + alternate fuel
  + final reserve fuel
  + additional fuel (if required)
* extra fuel (added by operations for known delays)
* discretionary fuel (at discretion of the Commander)

### Aircraft Mass Terminology

**Maximum Take-off Mass (MTOM)** = structural limit (which must be never exceeded) or a performance limit.

**Maximum Landing Mass (MLM)** = structural limit - not to be exceeded in normal operations - or a performance limit.

**Maximum Zero Fuel Mass (MZFM)** = structural limit    
=> **Zero Fuel Mass (ZFM)**  = total mass of the aeroplane less the usable fuel.    
Any fuel in tanks which cannot be transferred to the engines (unusable fuel) forms part of the ZFM.

**Basic Empty Mass (BEM)** = mass of airframe, engines, lubricating oil, unusable fuel, and the equipment required for all roles of the aeroplane (e.g. pax seats, cargo restraints).

**Variable Load (VL)** = weight of the crew and their baggage and equipment, food, beverages, water, and any special equipment required for a particular aeroplane mode.

**Dry Operating Mass (DOM)** = sum of BEM and VL.    
DOM does not entail usable fuel and payload.

**Payload** = combined weight of the passengers and their baggage, cargo and mail (~ what brings revenue ~ pay).

**Traffic Load** = payload plus non-revenue load.    
$traffic load + DOM = ZFM$.

**Take-Off Mass (TOM)** = weight (mass) of the aeroplace at the start of the take-off run.    
$TOM = ZFM + takeoff fuel$.

**Operating Mass (OM)** = sum of DOM plus take-off fuel = TOM minus traffic load.

**Ramp Mass (RM)** or **Taxy Mass** = total mass of the aircraft and its contents at start up.    
$RM (or taxymass) = ZFM + fuel load$.     
When the allowance for start-up and taxy fuel is subtracted, the fuel remaining is called take-off fuel and the resultatnt weight is the take off mass (TOM).

**Landing Mass (LM)** = mass of the aircraft on landing => $LM = TOM - trip fuel$.

**All Up Mass (AUM)** = total aircraft mass at a specified point.     
Also referred to as **Gross Mass**.


### Designators for Controlled, Advisory, and Uncontrolled ATS Routes

ICAO Annex 11 and AIP describe airways and associated designators.   
Designator shall not exceed 6 characters, normally 5.   
Basic designator: letter followed by number 1 ... 999:

* A,B,G,R routes forming part of the regional routes - non-RNAV
* L,M, N, P regional RNAV routes
* H,J,V,W   non-regional networks of ATS routes - non RNAV routes
* Q,T,Y,Z non-regional RNAV routes.

Where applicable, one supplementary letter can be added as prefix  

* K = low-level route, primarily helicopter (spoken as KOPTER)
* U = route of portion estabilshed in the upper airspace (spoke as UPPER)
* S = route established exclusively for use by supersonic aircraft during accerleration and deceleration and while in supersonic flight (sponek as SUPERSONIC)

examples: L620 (Lima 6-2-0), UL620 (UPPER Lima 6-2-0), Q295

An ATS authority can assign supplementary letter after the designator to indicate the type of servie provided.   
However, this designator may not be displayed to the pilot on some some types of equipment, and the crew is not required to use them in radio communications:

* F indicated that only an advisory service is provided on the route or portion of the route
* G indicates that only a flight information service is provided on the route or portion of the route

### Meteorology - Weather Information

Significant weather charts (Sig WX charts or prognostic charts) - may differ in format based on route, aeroplane type/operating altitudes and range.

E.g. piston engine -> low-level (below 10000ft) weather chart

High level CHarts (operating up to 40000ft or higher).
On high-level charts the surface conditions are not particularly important, but the location of jet streams, areas of cumulonimbus and thunderstorms (implying moderate to severe turbulence and icing), and areas of Clear Air Turbulence (CAT).

check for symbology - MET.

Wind and Temperature Charts -> planning ~ forecast of wind and temperatures. Charts exists in differnt formats.

low-level wind and temperature ~ spot wind chart ~ at various selected latitude and longitudes, spot winds and temperatures are indicated.    
Values for intermediate points can be extracted for planning purposes.

high-level wind and temperature ~ typically showing wind systems, direction and strength

Note: temps are assumed to be negative in UPPER airspace unless stated otherwise, e.g. 36 = minus 36 degrees Celsius, PS2 = plus 2 deg C

```{r}
#| label: fig-airlaw-wind-symbology
#| fig-cap: wind symbology
 
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/airlaw-met-wind-symbology.png")
```

**aerodrome reports and forecasts** meteorological aerodrome reports (METAR) and Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF).    
METAR within current reporting period (typically 30 mins).    
TAF forecast of weeather expected over stated period of time.

For planning purposes, the weather at the departure, destination, and alternate aerodromes will be considered for a period of your estimated time of arrival -/+ 1 hour.

Operations Manual specifies weather minima for destination and diversion aerodromes.    
Approach minima are established by the Operator, approved by the Authority based on rules in EU OPS.

## Approach Charts

guidance from initial approach fix IAF or radar vectors to the runwway and missed approach procedure

### Instrument Approach Procedures

* arrival segment = transition from en-route to approach phase - normally via Standard Arrival Procedure (STAR) ending at the initial approach fix IAF or via an RNAV Transition.
* initial approach segment starts at IAF, aircraft descent to position for approach. Often aircraft are vectored to the Intermediate Fix (IF) at which the initial approach segment ends.
* intermediate approach Segment starts at IF which is normally on or within 30 degrees of the extended centerline and ends    
  + for non-precision approaches at the Final Approach Fix (FAF), or
  + for precision approaches at the Final Approach Point (FAP).     
  
  Note: the IF is normally not identified on the Instrument Approach Chart as IF. In practical terms the aircraft speed and configuratio should be adjusted to prepare for the Final Approach (starting at FAF or FAP), thus, the descent gradient is kept as shallow as possible.
  
  Note2: for RNP approaches, a 10NM waypoint on the extended centerline is used and can be labelled as IAF or IF dependent upon the design of the approach. This point is the waypoint where the final approach course of a T approach meets the crossbar of the T (?!?!?)
  
* Final Approach Segment starts at the FAF/FAP and ends at the Missed Approach Point (MAPt).
* Missed Approach Segment starts at MAPt and terminates at point (NDB, radial and DME, or an altitude/height).     
  If a missed approach is initiated before the MAPt, thenthe aircraft is flown to the MAPt and then follows the missed approach procedure to remain within the protected airspace.
  
### Approach Chart Sections

example: ILS DME approach for London Heathrow runway 27R

chart comprises 4 sections    
* HEADING SECTION
* Approach Plan View
* approach profile view
* landing minima

heading section provides name, identifier, approach aid, frequencies, elevation, and missed approach procedure

plan view generally drawn to scale (noted otherwise), shows approach path and tracking details from the IAF to the approach air and Final Approach Fix (FAF)

not all instrument approaches have an Intermediate Fix (IF) (normally within 30 deg of centreline)

runways - location and orientation    
reporting points - compulsory and non-compulsory    
tracks and distances - magnetic tracks and distances for the approach procedure     

missed approach path - path to be followed, depicted as dashed line.

example Stuttgart/EDDS, non-standard left-turn holding at Luburg LBU R357 inbound (track: 177)

altitudes - procedure altitudes to be flown

radio aids - location of all radio navigation aids of the instrument approach and associated indications at key waypoints

obstructions - locations of all relevant obstructions (obstacles, mountaines) and associated altitudes

restricted airspace(s) - any restricted airspace (EDDS, powerplant on ILS final approach)

altitude vs distance table - tabulated information on altitudes (heights) versus distance for an approach WITHOUT a serviceable glide path signal.    
The glide slope is shown for ILS procedure or the Vertical Descent Angle VDA is given for the localiser only procedure. The relative descent rates (feet per minute) for the slope is given relative to the groundspeed in knots.

PROFILE VIEW - not drawn to scale, illustrates vertical profile of the approach path.

* heights and locations at which to intersect the glide path
* distances to threshold at various locations
* location of Final Approach Fix (FAF) = '*cross symbol*'
* missed approach point (MAPt) = point at which a missed approach should be initiated in order to preserve the required obstacle clearance limits.     
  + example EDDS: MAP for the full ILS := DA (1381ft)
  + for localiser only LOC := designated MAP (M) - in example overhead STG VOR / D0.7 ISTW or D1.4 from SGD DME with an MDA of 1590ft

  Note: lighting availability of touchdown zone TDZ, centerline lighting, ALS approach light system can impact RVR
* circling to land altitude/height minima are given (if relevant)
* rates of descent required at different ground speeds, in order to maintain the prescribed glide path.

## Route Planning

planning exercise: Heathrow to Amsterdam/Schiphol

* find aerodromes EGLL and EHAM on E(LO) chart - assumed FL = FL190;     
  tip: pick LON first to be in right area of chart     
  draw line between both aerodromes
* pick SID and STAR    
  assume light westerly wind: EGLL R27L/R; EHAM (many options) 18
* westerly departure from EGLL will take us to airway at BROOKMANS PARK   
  routing as short as possible/almost direct

HEATHROW standard instrument departure SID
* possible route entry: BROOKMANS PARK, CLACTON, or LAMBOURNE, easterly routes to the EAST being one-way     
  no SID for CLACTON or LAMBOURNE; Heathrow 10-3 lists BPK 7F and 7G departures runways 27R/L to BROOKMANS PARK
  + ruwnay selection will be ATC choice (dependent traffic volume, operational constraints, gate, etc.)
  + assumption: 27R => SID BROOKMANS PARK 7F, i.e., BPK 7F
  
PLAN = depiction of SID procedure, textual information at bottom;     
example:      
  + based on radials and distances from various NAVAIDS
  + LON 113.6, designator 'D' := DME
  + EGLL ELEV 83ft, TA 6000ft
  + climb straight ahead after take-off then turnright at D3 from LON DME onto 299 radial inbound to BURNHAM (BUR); BUR = NDB, 421kHz.
  + at D6 LON (waypoint) right turn to intercept 056 inbound CHILTERN CHT, NDB 277kHz
  + BROOKMANS PARK BPK = VOR DME, frequency 117.5
  + average track mileage ~ take-off to BPK - given for climb planning
  + speed control: max 250kt below FL100 is a fairly standard rule at most international airports for both, departures and arrivals.
  + minimum safe altitude within 25NM (unless stated otherwise): all London departure area LON VOR 2100ft
  
ATS routing    
  + check low level enroute chart, from BPK there is only 1 viable route: O295 to CLACTON VOR/DME, then L620 through REDGA on FIR boundary to TULIP.
  + walk along route (segments); note distances and surrounding information, e.g. center frequencies, distance between fixes, reporting point REDFA (FIR boundary crossing point London/Amsterdam)

ARRIVAL ROUTING     
  + identify AMSTERDAM AREA CHART 10-1 for overview, find TULIP (and entry from REDFRA) along L620
  + options: TULIP to SPIJKERBOOR VOR/DME via Y12 or TULIP to PAMPUS VOR/DME via L620 and BASNO reporting point
  + now check STARS for EHAM: only 1 STAR for aircraft arriving from the west via REDFA == REDFA 1A
  
REDFA 1A STAR    
  + gen info, ATIS, ELEV, radar vectors = arrival applicable for all runways
  + max 250kts below FL100, IAF = SUGOL; tracking inboud DEN Helder VOR/DME to SOLUT, then 077 to SUGOL 31NM on 292 from SPL
  
APPROACH FROM SUGOL (IAF) to EHAM R18 = instrument approach procedure, 3 parallel runways -> ILS for runway 18R ==> approach 11-4
  + routes from SUGOL to SPL VOR/DME to commence procedure; recall: REDFA arrivals from IAF to intermediate fix IF may be vectored by ATC!
  + heading and communications ATIS --> GND
  + APPROACH BRIEFING INFORMATION and MSA; ILS ident/frequency VPB 110.1; final approach course: 183, minimum altitudes on GS (if published, none for this procedure), procedure DA/H; aerodrome elevation -11ft, runway touchdown zone TDZE -13ft
  + missed approach procedure

APPROACH MINIMA    
minima section comprises approach type, aircraft approach category (approach speek) and available aerodrome lighting

title STANDARD signals values are compliant with EASA AIR OPS. State values supplied as compared to EASA AIR OPS and the higher of the two published

approach types:    
  + ILS runway 18R
  + localiser only (no glideslope)
  + circle to land
  
aircraft approach categories:    
  + A ... D; most jets ~ D
  + associated minima for each category; can differ e.g. Circling Approach
  
for ILS: DA = 187ft above MSL/DH = 200ft above ground     
Note: here DH > DA as aerodrome is below MSL (runway elevation of -13ft)    
DA(H) remain constant, but the required RVR depends on availability/status of lighting system (FULL, LIMITED, OUT)    
Note: RVR increases for LOCALISER ONLY for category A and B, or a converted meteorological visibility (CMV) of 2400m for category C and D;    
for LOC ONLY DA(H) increases to 690ft MSL/703ft AGL

circling to land minima per aircraft category and maximum circline speeds;    
category D:  circling minima 890ft MSL/901ft AGL with a min visibility of 3600m to maneuver to another runway.

The note states limitations on the circling approach, i.e., circling to 18L or 36L are not permitted except in an emergency.

* air traffic detail includeing frequencies and agencies;
* aircraft mass and fuel details;
* alternate aerodrome details and routings;
* FIR boundaries
* weather detail - forecast OAT and wind

an operational flight plan is typically produced 'hours' before the actual flight, i.e., it might not have the 'latest' information or changes (e.g. routing, runway, weather detail)    
captain required to verify/update operational flight plan

standard/dummy template    
* MSA minimum safe altitude (either MSA when on SID or STAR, or Grid Minimum Safe Altitude when enroute)
* AWY name or designator of waypoint
* FL planned flight level
* W/P FREQ waypoint name, navigation aid frequency
* LAT/LON (often omitted for legs and often attached as list to OPS PLAN)
* TAS planned true airspeed in knots
* W/V forecast wind (deg/kt)
* G/S planned groundspeed based on forecast wind/OAT
* OAT forecast outside air temperature
* MTK magnetic track
* HDG magnetic heading
* LEG DIST leg distance (ground NM)
* DIST TO GO remaining distance to destination
* TIME leg time
* ETA continuous (elapsed) time from take-off, completed after take-off time is recorded in UTC
* ACTM continuous time from T/O - estimated elapsed time
* ATA actual time of arrival (UTC) - completed during flight over each waypoint
* FUEL REQ minimum FUEL REQuired to complete sector

enter airway name

enter MTK and LEG DIST

use navigation computer to calculate heading HDG and groundspeed GS for cruise legs

complete distance to go

transfer details to OPS PLAN

### Cruising Flight Levels

* aeroplane performance and mass - goal: operate at most fuel efficient (flight) level (to keep costs down). I.e., jets ~ as high as possible, aeroplane mass is an obvious consideration (as it limits which level can be reached)
* weather - temperature and wind influence 'performance'. OAT limits operating ceiling (high temperatures ~ reduced performance); wind ~ reduce time in headwind, opt for beneficial tailwinds ==> influences flight level choice and cruise speed.
* terrain and obstacles - maintain minimum clearance from terrain and obstacles. 
* air traffic rules - ICAO semi-circular IFR cruising levels ensure a minimum separation between aircraft on opposite tracks. Consider RVSM vs non-RVSM separation.

BELOW FL290    ==> at or above FL290 ICAO "standard" levels separated by 2000ft, in RVSM airspace (again) 1000ft 
359M  360M
even  odd
200   210
220   230
180M  179M

at above FL290: EVEN 310 350 ... ODD 290 (we start ODD at FL290!) 330

EVEN levels go to the EAST

above FL410 rules revert to ICAO semi-circular cruising levels - even in RVSM airspace

## COMMUNICATIONS

### Position Reporting

a controlled flight must    
  + maintain 2 way communication     
  + report the time and level of passing each compulsory reporting point and others as required by ATC
  
in the absence of specified reporting points, position reports are made as required by the appropriate ATS authority.   

In Europe, IFR flight operations are typically under radar control == reporting only as required by ATC

### Communication Failure

* IFR - VMC ==> continue in VMC and land at the nearest suitable aerodrome, report arrival by the most expeditions means to ATC
* IFR - IMC and not under radar (no regional agreement applies) ==> maintain the last assigned speed and level or minimum flight altitude if higher for a period of 20 mins following the aircraft's failure to report its position over a compulroy reporting point and thereafter adjust flight level and speed in accordance with filed flight plan.
* IFR & IMC & under radar (no regional agreement applies) ==> maintain the last assigned speed and level, or minimum flight altitude if higher, for a period of 7 minutes following setting mode 3/A 7600 failure to report last assigned level achieved whichever is later, then proceed in accordance with filed flight plan
* IFR & IMC & being vectored or directed by ATC to proceed offset using RNAV without a specified limit ==> proceed in the most direct manner possible to rejoin current flight plan route no later than the next significant point, taking into consideration the applicable minimum flight altitude.
* IFR & IMS & under radar climb (regional air navigation agreement applies) ==>  climb to maintain for a period of three minutes the level to which you were cleared 
and then continue in accordance with current flight plan

### Long Range Flights

some areas low traffic density - most attractive direct route

areas/countries affected by political factors compelling overflyhing aircraft to follow certain pre-scribed routes and require rigid compliance within the defined boundaries of these routes/corridors

remote areas more and more establishing some form of ATS - generally laid down in procedures to ensure safety levels.    
e.g. north atlantic region: rules of procedures for trans-atlantic flights

### Minimum Time Routes and Minimum Cost Routes

minimum time routes = shortest route between 2 points in terms of time. in no wind: great circle. with wind: minimum time route changes and requires constructing/sampling different routes to take into account the wind effect.

minimum cost route is the route that will result in the lowest cost and most economic path.     
affected by:    
  + choice of flight level
  + cruise technique
  + enroute winds and temperature.    

The minimum cost route takes also into account fuel, turn around, and overflight costs.

Economic considerations:     
  + if fuel is cheap it might be more efficient to fly faster ~ burn more fuel, but save engine and airframe hours     
  + if fuel is more expensive, it might be cheaper overall to fly slowly.    
  
The minim cost route could be longer in terms of time (flight duration) than the minimum time route. By definition cannot be less!


## Basic Flight Planning Calculations

### Heading, Track, Drift

heading := angle of ac to north datum; true north ~ true heading; magnetic north ~ magnetic heading

track or course := path of ac over ground. Desired path := **required track**; actual flown path := **track made good**.

angle between required track and actual track (made good) := **track error angle**

drift := angle between ac heading and track made good. "port" drift when track made good is less than the heading, "starbord drift" when track made good is greater than heading.

"drift goes from heading to track" -> drift left/port, drift right/starboard

### Wind Correction Angle

compensate for effect of wind (and associated drift) -> steer ac from required track INTO the wind.

required track: 156
WCA              7L
heading:         149

or     
heading       : 149
drift         :   7R   drift and wind correction "opposite sign"
track made good: 156

### Wind Calculations

NAV computer -> CHECK AND PRACTICE

True Heading & True Air Speed ~ motion of aircraft        >     
True Track & Ground Speed     ~ motion of ac over ground  >>    
wind & velocity               ~ wind impact               >>>

finding groundspeed    
- required track 100deg true, TAS 190kt
- wind velocity 320deg true/35kt    
what is the required heading to fly track and will be the ground sepped?

### Graphical Methods of Determining Average Winds

ICE-T  - Pussy Cat Dolls

IAS 
      ~ corrected for instrument and Position errors gives
CAS 
      ~ corrected for Compressibility
EAS
      ~ corrected for Density
TAS

compressibility error/correction applied above 300kt TAS
corrrection   (TAS / 100) - 3    
example 445kt => 4.45 - 3 = 1.45

(unsure how to handle this on a circular E6B)


### Mach Numbers

Mach number ~ how fast as a proportion of the local speed of sound LSS.   
Local speed of sound varies with temperature.

M > 1 := supersonic.

M -> TAS for navigation purposes

$$Machnumber = \frac{TAS}{LSS}$$
$$TAS = Machnumber * LSS$$

$$LSS = 38.94 * \sqrt{Tempabsolut}$$
absolute zero = -273 degrees Celsius <=> 0 Celsius = 273 A

TAS of ac flying at M 0.82 at FL310 and OAT -40deg C
EB6 ==> mach index pointer on Temp = scale read TAS, flight level irrelevant, compressibility can be neglected

Math:    
TAS = M * LSS = M * ( 38.94 * sqrt(273 -40)) 
    0.82 * ( 38.94 * sqrt(233))
    0.82 * (38.94 * 15.26)
    0.82 * 594
    = 487kt
    

for required ETA => ac must fly 480kt, FL350, OAT = -55    
what is Machnumber

E6B 0.835

TAS = M * LSS
M = TAS / LSS = 480 / ( 38.94 * sqrt(273 - 55))
480 / (38.94 * 14,77) = 480 / 574,94 = 0.835

ac M0.77, FL290, OAT -48    
ASI reads?

TAS = M * LSS = 0.77 * (38.94 * sqrt(273 - 48))
    = 449,76kt ~ 450kt
    
    check again how to get from TAS > 300kt to CAS with compressibility (here 1.5 divisions)
    450kt -> CAS* 289 => 295kt
    
### Speed, Distance, and Time Calculations

calc side 10 <>1hr = 60 mark

478kt, time for 135NM
speed: 478NM/60min => set 60 mark under 478

185NM in 24 min => 185 over 24 ==> 60 mark shows 460NM/60min = 460kt


### Other Uses

Distance Conversions

1200NM => outer scale NM index/place 12
==> 1380 SM (given SM index)
==> 22.2 against km ~ 22.200 km


NM * 1.15 = SM     
NM * 1.852 = km
NM * 6080  = ft
km * 3280 = ft
NM * 1852 = m

### Fuel Calculations

all nav computers are capable of fuel flow calculations

ac uses 1800lbs in 23 mins    
fuel flow per hour   
E6B    18/23  -> 47/60 ~ 4700lbs/60min

ac burns 6200lbs/hr    
how muhc used in 28 mins    
E6B   62/60 -> 29/28min ~ 2900lbs/28min


ac uses 6200lbs/hr with a ground speed of 420kt    
fuel usage per NM     
note: fuel flow and speed in hrs!    
6200/420 = 620/42 ~ 62/42 -> 10marker ~ 1 unit ==> 14.75 lbs/NM

### Fuel Conversions

SG := specific gravity

1 imp gal     = 1.2 USgal     = 4.54l
1 im gal of water (SG = 1.0)  = 10lb
1 imp gal of fuel (SG = 0.8)  = 8lb
1 l of water      (SG = 1.0)  = 1kg
1 l of fuel       (SG = 0.8)  = 0.8kg


1000imp gal of fuel with SG of 0.8 in kg   
rough: about 4kg or 4 liters in a gallon ~ 4000kg or 4000l
???

1000lb in litres


E6B
$$\frac{fuelweight}{"10"} = \frac{pounds}{gallons}$$

$$\frac{fuelflow}{rate} = \frac{fuelconsumption}{timeminutes}$$

## Flight Plans

### Requirement to File a Flight Plan

FPL shall contain all information relevant to an intended flight

* flight or any portion of it is to be provided with ATC services
* flight is under IFR within Advisory Airspace
* flight is within, or into, a designated area or along a designated route when the appropriate ATS require it, in order to facilitate the provision of Flight Information and alerting and rescue services;
* flight is within or into a designated area or along a designated route when the appropriate ATS require it in order to facilitate coordination with appropriate military units or with ATS units in adjacent States in order to avoid the possible need for interception for the purpose of identification; or
* flight is to cross international borders.

FPL may cover complete flight or portions for those portions requiring a particular clearance.    
Check completeness and correctness of information, including confriming NOTAMs for NAVAIDs/aeronautical facilities and services, procedure, or hazard which may affect flight.

### Submission

FPL may be submitted    
+ before flight to an ATS reporting office; or
+ during flight by RT to the appropriate ATS unit or air ground control radio station (AIRFILED)

FPL to be submitted before flight requiring ATC service or air traffic Advisory Service, at least 60 minutes before departure, i.e., EOBT.

If AIRFILED: at least 10 minutes before entering    
+ intended point of entry into a Control Area CTA or Advisory Area; or
+ point of crossing an airway or advisory route.

FPL for IFR flights over North Atlantic and on routes subject to ATFMshould be filed a minimum of 3 hours before EOBT.    
ATFM might apply to certain busy airways at particular times of day or be applied when there are problems in the ATC system.

If departure is delayed, FPL shall be amended or re-submitted, if delay exceeds     
+ 30 min in case of controlled flights; or
+ 60 min for an uncrontrolled flights.

If flight requires control, it must not depart BEFORE clearance is received.    
If only advisory service is required, the flight should await acknowledgement of receipt of the plan before departure.   
Please note that the times given for filing/delays of flight plans are the standard ICAO requirement.    
Individual State and Aerodrome requirements may well differ.

A "current flight plan" is a filed flight plan with amendments and clearances included.

### Actions on an ATC Cleared Flight Plan

within certain limits, ac must adhere to the submitted plan unless clearance has been obtained for a change or an emergency requires deviation from it.    
In the latter case the deviation must be reported as soon as possible to the appropriate ATS unit together with the reason for the diversion.

Inadvertent changes of a controlled flight from its plan must be dealt with as follows:    
+ if ac is discovered to be off track action shall be taken to regain track fothwith;
+ EASA regulations: if TAS changes by more than 5% of the flight planned TAS the appropriate ATS must be informed. Note: ICAO regulations required variation of -/+ 0.02 Mach or more, or -/+ 19km/h (10kts) TAS or more, from the current flight plan must be reported.
+ if the ETA at significant reporting point is likely to change by 2 minutes or more from that already notified, it must be reported to the ATS unit together with a revised estimate.

Requests for changes should include the following information:    
* for a change of cruising level
  + ac identification
  + requested new level together with the cruising speed at that level and consequent changes to time estimates
* for a route change with unchanged destination:
  + ac identification, flight rules (VFR/IFR)
  + requested new route together with the cruising speed and level and relevant time estimates.
* for a route change with changed destination
* as above but with the addition of the new destination and alternate(s)
* change from IFR to VFR
  + only acceptable when a message initiated by the PIC containing specific expression "Cancelling My IFR Flight" together with changes, if any to be made to the current FPL is received air traffic.
* landing at an aerodrome other than the filed destination
  + inform filed destination ad asap. There is a rule (ICAO)  that states you should do this within 30 minutes of landing.
  
For a VFR flight encoutering IMC     
If -- because or worsening WX -- it appears that it will not be possible to continue in VMC, a VFR flight operated as a controlled flight shall:

* request an amended clearance to continue to destination or an alternate or to leave the airspace for which ATC clearance is required
* if no such amended clearance can be contained , continue in VMC and notify the approp ATC unit of the action being taken to leave the airspace or to land at the neearest suitable aerodrome
* if operating within a control zone, apply for special VFR SVFR status
* request IFR clearance

## Tips

measure distance on VFR chart and compare length at latitude grid ~ exact(er) distance - why not using measure (do I have this at the exam)?
