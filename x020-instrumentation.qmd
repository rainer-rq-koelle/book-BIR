1. Basic Concepts of Aircraft Instrumentation

Aircraft instruments translate physical phenomena into usable cockpit information.

Categories:

Flight instruments → attitude, altitude, speed, heading, turn rate.

Engine instruments → fuel, oil, manifold pressure, RPM, EGT/CHT.

Navigation instruments → VOR, ILS, GNSS, ADF.

Principles of operation:

Mechanical instruments: rely on pressure or gyroscopic motion.

Electrical/electronic instruments: use sensors, data buses, and displays.

👉 Study Tip: Always think what physical property is being measured and what errors can affect it.

2. Pitot-Static System & Air Data Instruments
Components:

Pitot tube → measures dynamic pressure (q = ½ρV²).

Static port(s) → measures ambient atmospheric pressure.

Instruments:
Instrument	Principle	Key Errors/Limitations
Airspeed Indicator (ASI)	Compares pitot (total) pressure vs static → dynamic pressure → IAS	Position error, compressibility, density altitude
Altimeter	Aneroid capsules expand/contract with static pressure vs ISA model	Wrong QNH/QFE, temperature error, lag
Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)	Rate of change of static pressure via calibrated leak	Lag, temporary errors (accelerations)
Failure Modes:

Blocked pitot, clear static → ASI reads like altimeter, VSI zero.

Blocked static, clear pitot → ASI unreliable, altimeter and VSI frozen.

👉 Mnemonic: If it looks odd — suspect the static system.

3. Temperature & Pressure Measurement Systems

OAT probe: resistance thermometer. Corrected for compressibility at high speeds (TAT).

Manifold pressure gauge: measures absolute pressure in intake manifold.

Oil pressure/temperature: mechanical or electrical transmitters.

Fuel quantity: float sensors, capacitance probes.

👉 Pilots need awareness of limitations (e.g., fuel gauges only reliable when empty).

4. Magnetism and Compass Instruments
Direct-Reading Magnetic Compass:

Simple, passive, mandatory backup.

Subject to:

Variation (difference between true and magnetic north).

Deviation (local fields inside aircraft).

Turning/acceleration errors (due to dip).

Rules of Thumb (Northern Hemisphere):

ANDS → Accelerate North, Decelerate South.

UNOS → Undershoot North, Overshoot South (when rolling out on headings).

Remote/Flux Gate Compass:

Uses sensors and gyros to electronically stabilise heading.

Feeds data to HSIs and EFIS.

5. Gyroscopic Instruments
Principles:

Rigidity in space → gyro resists change in orientation.

Precession → force applied moves 90° later in rotation.

Key Instruments:

Attitude Indicator (AI): Pitch + bank. Errors: tumbling, acceleration errors.

Heading Indicator (HI): Gyro-stabilised; needs compass alignment due to drift.

Turn Coordinator: Senses roll and yaw → displays rate of turn (standard rate = 3°/s).

👉 Cross-check instruments: AI + compass/HI + VSI/ASI.

6. Electronic Flight Instrumentation (EFIS)
Glass Cockpit:

PFD (Primary Flight Display): combines AI, ASI, altimeter, VSI, HI.

MFD (Multi-Function Display): navigation, weather, engine/system info.

Advantages:

Reduced workload, better situational awareness, integrated warnings.

Limitations:

Complexity → “mode confusion”.

Reliability depends on electrical power and software.

👉 Always keep basic instrument scan skills as backup.

7. Autopilot and Flight Director

Autopilot (AP): maintains selected modes (HDG, ALT, NAV, APR).

Flight Director (FD): command bars show correct control inputs.

Pilot Awareness:

Know which mode is engaged.

Always be ready to disconnect and hand-fly.

Trust but verify.

8. Alerting and Warning Systems

Master Warning/Master Caution lights → require pilot acknowledgment.

Aural alerts: stall warning, overspeed clacker, GPWS/EGPWS.

Trend indicators on EFIS help anticipate problems.

👉 Treat warnings as action prompts, not suggestions.

9. Navigation and GNSS/FMS Basics

FMS: integrates sensors + databases to calculate nav and performance solutions.

GNSS (GPS, Galileo): main BIR navigation enabler.

RAIM (Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring): ensures accuracy and integrity.

Limitations:

Susceptible to jamming/spoofing.

Database validity crucial (AIRAC cycle).
