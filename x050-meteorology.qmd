1. Introduction to Aviation Meteorology

Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere and its phenomena.

For pilots, the focus is on weather conditions that affect flight safety and performance.

Key elements: pressure, temperature, humidity, wind, clouds, visibility, hazards.

Understand ICAO Annex 3 (Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation) and associated EU rules.

2. The Atmosphere

Divided into layers: Troposphere (up to ~36,000 ft mid-latitudes), Tropopause, Stratosphere.

Most aviation weather occurs in the troposphere.

Lapse rate: standard 2¬∞C per 1,000 ft.

ISA (International Standard Atmosphere):

Sea level: 15¬∞C, 1013.25 hPa.

Pressure decreases ~27 ft per hPa.

üëâ Pilots use ISA as a reference for altimetry, performance, and weather interpretation.

3. Pressure and Wind

Pressure systems:

High (anticyclone): sinking air, stable, light winds, clear skies.

Low (depression): rising air, unstable, clouds, precipitation.

Wind:

Caused by pressure gradients.

Modified by Coriolis effect (deflects to the right in NH).

Near the surface: slowed and turned by friction.

Gradient wind vs geostrophic wind:

Aloft winds flow parallel to isobars.

Near surface, they cross isobars towards low pressure.

4. Temperature, Humidity, and Stability

Relative humidity (RH): ratio of actual water vapor to saturation.

Dewpoint: temperature at which air becomes saturated ‚Üí clouds/fog.

Stability:

Stable air: resists vertical motion ‚Üí stratiform clouds, poor visibility, smooth air.

Unstable air: encourages vertical currents ‚Üí cumuliform clouds, turbulence, showers.

üëâ Rule of Thumb: Temperature decreasing faster than 2¬∞C/1,000 ft = unstable.

5. Clouds and Precipitation

Cloud classifications:

Stratus: flat, stable.

Cumulus: heaped, convective.

Cirrus: high-level ice clouds.

Cloud development: lifting ‚Üí cooling ‚Üí condensation.

Precipitation forms: rain, snow, hail, drizzle.

Ceiling & visibility determine VFR/IFR conditions.

6. Air Masses and Fronts

Air mass: large body of air with uniform temp/humidity.

Fronts:

Cold front: fast-moving, steep slope, cumulus, showers, turbulence.

Warm front: gentle slope, stratiform clouds, steady rain, poor vis.

Occluded front: combination, widespread cloud/rain.

Stationary front: little movement, prolonged poor weather.

üëâ For IFR: expect significant weather changes at frontal passages.

7. Aviation Hazards

Turbulence: mechanical (terrain), convective, wind shear, CAT (clear air turbulence).

Icing:

Forms in supercooled liquid water regions.

Types: rime (opaque, rough), clear (glassy, heavy), mixed.

Dangers: weight, drag, blocked sensors, loss of lift.

Thunderstorms: require moisture + instability + lifting.

Hazards: turbulence, hail, icing, microbursts, lightning.

Fog types: radiation, advection, upslope, frontal.

8. Weather Charts and Forecasts

Surface charts: pressure systems, isobars, fronts.

Upper air charts: jet streams, turbulence zones.

Significant Weather (SIGWX) charts: areas of turbulence, icing, cloud tops.

METAR/SPECI: coded actual weather.

TAF: terminal forecasts.

SIGMET/AIRMET: warnings for en-route weather hazards.

üëâ Pilots must be fluent in METAR/TAF decoding.

9. Meteorological Information for IFR Flight

Pre-flight: study TAF/METAR, SIGWX, NOTAMs.

En-route: ATIS, VOLMET, ATC updates, onboard weather radar.

Decision-making: always plan for alternates considering weather minima.
