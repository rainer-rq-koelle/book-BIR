## Flight Intruments - "six pack"

* pitot-static instruments
  + airspeed indicator ASI
  + altimeter
  + vertical speed indicator VSI
* gyroscopic intruments
  + attitude indicator AI (sometimes called artificial horizon)
  + heading incdicator (or directional gyro)
  + Turn coordinator
  
## Air Temparature

Temperature probe of an aircraft measure the Total Air Temperature (TAT).   
TAT includes friction and ram rise.   
TAT >= SAT

At lower speeds, OAT (SAT) ~ TAT, as friction and ram rise does not play a role.

Speed (of faster) aircraft create temperature measurement problem.
Measurement results are distorted by frictional heating, ditto on static air accelerated with aircraft and used to measure temperature.

increase in sensed temperature is called * **kinetic heating** (or ram rise) *.
The kinetic heating/ram rise in temperature is due to adiabatic compression.

* **static air temperature SAT / outside air temperature OAT / Corrected outside air temperature COAT** ambient outside temperature = temperature measured if you were in the basket of a ballon holding a thermometer (non-accelerated, slow moving)
* **total air temperature TAT / measured impact temperature** (higher) temperature sensed by a (fast) moving aircraft.

TAT = SAT (OAT) + ram rise

The (total) conversion of kinetic energy to heat can be calculated:

$$TAT = SAT * (1 + 0.2 M^2) $$
Temperatures SAT/TAT in Kelvin K  (!= Celsius or Fahrenheit)

Conversion loss as there is no perfect thermodynamic conversion. --> conversion factor, i.e., recovery factor K, K < 1. Typical values K =0.9.

$$TAT = SAT * (1 + 0.2 *K * M^2) $$
$$SAT (or\ OAT) = \frac{TAT}{1 + 0.2 * K * M^2}$$

Example: Mach number 0.7, measured impact temp = -48deg C, recovery factor K of 0.85.

TAT in Kelvin: -48C + 273 = 225 K
$M^2$ = 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49

$$SAT = \frac{255}{1 + 0.2 * 0.85 * 0.49} = \frac{255}{1 + 0.0833} = 208 K$$
Kelvin to Celcius: 208 - 273 - -65degC

Higher speed "rams" air into thermometer and gets compressed (a bit) causing increase in temperature: $$Ram\ rise = SAT * 0.2 * M^2$$

## Pitot Static System

![pitot-static-system and instruments (FAA flying handbook, figure 8-1)](figures/inst-pitot-static-system.png)

stationary aircraft (on ground) acted on from all directions by **ambient air pressure** or **static pressure**. Statis pressure is the atmospheric pressure.

movement through air "adds" **dynamic pressure**. Dynamic pressure is the kinetic energy changed to pressure energy/
The dynamic pressure is proportional to aircraft's speed:

$$dynamic\ pressure = 1/2 * \rho * v^2$$

$\rho$ air density    
$v$ true velocity of aircraft    

Dynamic pressure important as it represents the pressure of air flowing over the aircraft. Thus, relates to lift it creates and drag it experiencies. ~ flying characteristics of an aircraft.

### Pitot Tube

A sensing system detecting the total pressure on the front of the aircraft.    
Total pressure = dynamic pressure (movement) + static pressure (background).

To find dynamic pressure = need to separately sense the static (ambient background) pressure.

**Bernoulli principle**
==> total pressure = dynamic + static pressure ==> dynamic pressure = total pressure - static pressure

Separate measurement of static pressure also useful for height and rate of vertical change (i.e., climb and descent).

Static pressure vents or ports. Holes = vents are placed at right angle to the airflow. This avoids detecting the dynamic pressure.    
Some smaller aeroplane (not having multiple sensors) have a selectable standby static source inside the cabin. Unpressurised cabin ~ slightly lower (static) pressure due to aerodynamic suction.

combined pressure heads: measuring both, static and pitot/total pressure. "mast" to ensure sensors are outside boundary layer of aircraft skin.
Can have heater element = avoid blockage from icing, drain hole to exit water entering the tube.

### position error

Any error in detecting static pressure will give false instrument indications.

The sum total of all such errors is called **position error** (ex pressure error).

position error:

* predictable configuration error, and
* maneuever error (less predictable)

configuration: typically static sources are sited as far as possibly to be error free ~ some small remaining error which change with aircraft true airspeed and configuration (flaps, gears), and with angle of attack.

Such errors are established in flight testing = thus known ==> calibration cards, or in modern systems programmed out in the **air data computer**.

Note: standby instruments are not fed through ADC and - even in modern aircraft - have uncorrected position errors.

maneuver: rolling, pitching, or yawing, including random gusts may introduce transient and unpredictable static pressure errors.
These can therefore not be programmed out with ADC.

Extreme rolling/pitching unlike with transport aircraft.   
Errors related to yawing may be minimised by sitting static ports on both sides of fuselage.



## ASI - airspeed indicator 

good info: https://aerotoolbox.com/airspeed-indicator/

Your airspeed indicator, put simply, is a scale that measures the difference between the static pressure from your static ports, and the ram pressure (dynamic + static) from your pitot tube The static pressures cancel each other out, and you're left with dynamic pressure.

## Pressure Altimeter

The pressure altimeter measures the "barometric" difference in height between pressure levels.

calibration based on standard atmosphere   
- (mean) sea level pressure: 1013.25 hPa
- sea level density: 1225 g/m^3
- sea level temperature: 15 C
- temperature reduces with increasing altitude at 1.98 C per 1000ft
  + up to 36 090 ft at -56.6C staying constant to
  + 65617 ft then rising at 3C per 1000ft

```

detection of change in static air pressure

* simple altimeter
* sensitive altimeter
* servo assisted altimeter
* (modern systems) altitude calculated in ADC output to EFIS or servo-driven instrument

Simple altimeter:
- aneroid capsule connected to rotating needle    
- capsule expands with decreasing ambient air preassure --> higher altitude
- subscale allows adjustment to different datum pressure settings (e.g. QNH, standard, ...)
- rate of pressure decrease with increasing height is not constant ==> non-linear linkage
- read-out only correct for ISA condistions

Pressure in aneroid capsule: vacuum (or a very low pressure).   
Pressure in casing: static pressure.

![Altimeter (FAA Flying Handbook)](figures/inst-altimeter.png)

Sensitive altimeters: increased sensitivity by stack of 2 or more capsules (~ increased movement/change); vibrators to overceom static friction; more complex gearing allows to use 3 pointers (10000ft, 1000ft, and 100ft); others use drum or digital display with one pointer.

more modern variants: vibrator and pressure setting digitiser, both require electrical supply; digitised information can be used by transponder (automatic transmission)

servo-assisted altimeters: movement transmitted to a pivoted bar, i.e., the I-bar      
capsule stack (increased sensitivity) --> E/I-bar assembly sending signal to servo motor --> complex gearing --> digitiser for transmission of 1013hPa based ALT to transponder

ADC-driven altimeters: fourth generation system using static ambient pressure fed to ADC to calculate altitude referenced to both 1013hPa and selected subscale setting --> transponder , other feed to servo driven instrument or EFIS

accuracy requirements ICAO PANS-OPS (dependent on test/indication range):    
QFE/QNH accurately -/+ 20m or 60ft for range of 0-9000m or 0-30000ft   
or 25m or 80ft for 0-15000m or 0-50000ft

### Altimeter Errors

**Position Error**: position error can affect altimeter readings. Can be minimised by good design. Error varies with TAS and angle of attack.

**Instrument Error**: friction in the gearing 

**hysteresis error**: Any capsule based system will encounter problem that the aneroid capsulses themselves are not perfectly elastic and 'reluctant' to change shape after being at one pressure for a period of
time.

### Barometric Error

change of sea level pressure from the datum set on altimeter

==> resetting subscale to correct value

![barometric change](figures/inst-altimeter-barometric-error.png)
![temperature change](figures/inst-altimeter-temp-error.png)

HIGH pressure to low pressuer - altimeter over-reads; true alt decreases, while shown altitude stay constant
HIGH termp to lower temperature - altimeter over-reads, true alt decreases

high-low-high: flying from high pressure/temperature to low pressure/temperature ... altimeter show high(er than you are)

ditto for low-high-low

high-to-low, carful go! Im Winter sind the Berge hÃ¶her@

Temperature error correnction tables    
temp error in when flying in warm air --> alt under-read ... no issue, as you tend to climb.     
flying in cold air mass and at low altitudes! ~ landing!

Accordingly, temperature corrections must be applied to decision heights/altitudes, step down fixes, and even terminal minimum safe altitudes in temperatures of ISA -15C or below!

Error of line blockage (static line blocked) - pressure cannot change == no altitude change when climbing or descending

Fracture of static line - 'cabin pressure' will be measured rather than aircraft altitude.

In case of wrong altimeter reading - GPS could serve as alternative.    
Caution: 4 satelites needed for position fix including altitude. Without some form of GPS augmentation, GPS are not as accurate as pressure systems/instruments. GPS altitude error 1.5-3 times higher than positional error. Anecdotal evidence from mountaineers ~ up to 400ft.

### Altimeter Pressure Settings

* QFE - measures altitude about (local) field - zero on ground
  + airfield QFE is measured at highest point of airfield surface and generally correct for the whole airfield
  + touchdown QFE is measured at the touchdown of runway in use for precision approaches. Give accurate height about particular runway.

* QNH - measures altitude about mean sea level (AMSL) - shows field elevation on touchdown.
QNH is determined by measuring QFE and increasing it to sea level assuming ISA temparature values for the calculation.
  + airfield QNH is measured AMSL for the position of the aerodrome. It must be set at least on one altimeter when departing fom an aerodrome in controlled airspace.
  + in some States, a Regional or Zone QNH is available. This is the lowest QNH for the next hour within the Altimeter Setting Region (ASR) or Zone Area.
  
The air mass is not exactly ISA when Altimeter reads zero with QNH ~ you are not exactly at sea level.     
In cold air you will be above MSL. In warm air you will be below it.

The QNH and actual sea level pressure (QFF) will only be the same if the ambient conditions are - in fact - ISA.

The standard QNH is 1013.25 hPa or 29.92 in (inches of mercury).    
This setting makes the altimeter read a pressure altitude of Flight Level.    
This setting is used for traffic above the "transition level".

:::{.callout-note}
Exam questions is about working out difference between levels.
Sketch - biggest number at bottom (highest pressure level).
Then work with 30ft per hPA difference.
  30ft per hPa difference
:::

$$True \altitude = indicated\ altitude\ (QNH) + Temp\ correction$$
$$ Temp\ correction = 0.004 * ISA\ deviation * height\ air\ column\ ac&station$$
OAT = ISA - 10C, ISA deviation = OAT - ISA = -10C

station to be assumed at MSL!!! (not given)    
==> height 9500ft

Temp correction = 0.004 * (-10) * 9500 = -380ft    
True altitude = 9500ft + (-380ft) = 9120ft




### Density Altitude

Aircraft performance is dependent on density altitude.    
Density altitude is the altitude corrected for temperature.

In other words, the altitude in ISA which gives you the same air density as the prevailing non-ISA combination of temperature and pressure altitude.

To calculate density altitude

$$density\ altitude = pressure\ altitude + (120 * ISA\ deviation)$$
For example:

FL100 --> 10 000ft
OAT = -15C ==> -20
DA = 10 000ft + (120 * -20ft) = 10000ft - 2400ft = 7600ft


## Vertical Speed Indicator VSI

VSI records the rate of change of static pressure, and displays it as a rate of climb/descent.

Instrument consists of capsule fed with static pressure. The case is also fed with static pressure.    
Static feed to case is passed through a very small gap, the metering unit.    
If the aircraft changes its altitude, the capsule reacts immediately whilst the pressure change in the case is slower.    
The differential pressure is maintained as long as the aircraft continues to climb or descend. But once level, the pressure equalises and the rate of climb or descend returns to zero.

Key component: metering unit.
Metering unit uses a "choke" directing the air through both a capillary tube and a "knife edge orifice".

instantaneous VSis
simple VSI will not show rate of climb or descent immediately. There is time lag in indication while pressure difference between capsule and case builds up.

The IVSI counters this by including in the static line two weights in dashpots central with springs ... causing immediate differenial pressure because of the inertia as aircraft enters climb/descend.   
Dashpots are sometimes called "accelerometers".

Steep turns: IVSI will initially show a climb - stabilise - descent on rollout.    
Do not trust IVSI when turns > 40 degrees or changing load factor in turn.

Other systems for vertical speed

* modern strap-down inertial reference system IRS - vertical acceleration and velocity are available from IRS  as one of the accelerometers calculates movement in vertical axis.
* barometric height in electronic form from ADC, the rate of change of height can be calculated and displayed as vertical velocity.
* dynamic vane VSI - difference between static and metered static pressure induces a flow over moveable vanes, rather like a small air turbine instead of using a capsule. Movement of the vances records the vertical speek.

In practice, modern transport aircraft will use one of the two electronic systems driven by ADC or IRS

### Errors and blockage

instrument error - can be present. Can be largely compensated for with an adjusting screw that zeroes the reading.

lag - the basic VSI design sees a lag before a rate of climb or descent is indicated. This may take sometimes up to several seconds. IVSI overcomes this. Modern inertial systems do not suffer from this error.

static errors - error in the absolute value of static pressure produces NO error. However, a change in static pressure when none is due will give a false indicator of climb or descent.    
The pressure driven instrument is susceptible to maneuver errors, particularly during take-off and go-around, and in turbulence.

static blockage will cause the pressure driven instruments read zero in all circumstances.

static leak to the pressure cabin will ause the instrument to read cabin rate of climb and descent.

On start-up, all VSIs should read zero.

## Airspeed Indication

indicated airspeed ~ reference for handling the aircraft     
true airspeed ~ determine how far we fly in a given time --> navigation

dynamic pressure = basic measure of airspeed    

airspeed indicator are calibrated to read correctly at MSL under ISA conditions.   
at height/altitude, air density decreases --> same dynamic pressure reflects now a higher true airspeed (air is thinner ~ for same pressure aircraft needs to move faster).    
The same applies if the air is warmer than standard (warm air is thinner ~ for same pressure we have to move faster)

$$dynamic\ pressure = \frac{1}{2} * \rho * v^2$$
If $\rho$ air density reduces, velocity $v$ must increase for the same dynamic pressure.    

Other unit of airspeed: speed of the aircraft as a portion of the speed of sound --> *Mach* or *Mach number*

Knowledge of mach number important, because if aircraft approaches the speed of sound, the airflow around the aircraft changes (starting of shock waves). 
If aircraft is not designed for supersonic flights, this can have an impact on its stability, required extremes of control movements, and loss of control.     
Aircraft approaching speed of sound is marked by *airframe buffeting*.

IAS at low speeds; mach number at high speeds.    
TAS to be calculated by pilot or aircraft computers.


speed of sound:  
In the Earthâs atmosphere, the chief factor affecting the speed of sound is the temperature.

Earthâs atmosphere, the speed of sound is influenced by factors such as:

Temperature (the main factor)
Humidity
Altitude/Pressure
The speed of sound in the atmosphere is calculated using the following formula:

V_sound = 643.855 x (T / 273.15)^0.5

Where:

v_sound is the speed of sound in knots.
T is the air temperature in Kelvin.
643.855 is a constant used to calculate the speed of sound in knots.


Celsius to Kelvin: K = Â°C + 273.15
==> -40 + 273.15 = 233.15
==> 233.15 / 273.15 = 0.85  ~ 85 / 100  ~ (81 = 9^2) (85/100)^0.5 = 9/10 = 0.9 

### Flate Plate Indicators

earliest measurement of dynamic pressure ~ flat plate attached to wing --> deflected plate (spring) --> scale indicating airspeed according to deflection.   
Calibrated under ISA conditions: IAS correct at sea level.

### mechanical airspeed indicator

(light) aircraft: feeding of both, static and dynamic pressure to ASI.

pressured sealed case supplied with static pressure.    
inside the sealed case a capsule is supplied with dynamic pressure.     
With increasing airspeed the dynamic air pressure increases --> capsule expands --> mechanical link indicates airspeed (~ difference beteen dynamic and static pressure).

calibration: IAS at MSL under ISA == TAS.

Potential inaccuracy due to temperature effect on linkage. Potential bi-metal strips to reduce expansion/contraction.

### ADC driven instruments

Modern (and larger) aircraft feed the pitot and static pressure lines to an Air Data Computer --> electrical signal --> servo-driven mechanical display or EFIS screen.

Airspeed can be calculated from the pressures using formulae by Saint-Vernant.     
== calibrated airspeed CAS

### Errors

Any instrument subject to errors: sensor errors, mechanical inaccuracies or issues with design.

ASI subject to all

* instrument error - older mechanical systems will suffer from mechanical errors.
* position error - position errors linked to poor designed systems ~ less likely with modern aircraft. In modern aircraft the predictable element of position error (=configuration error) can be eliminated by ADC.

## Calibrated Airspeed

IAS = dynamic pressure reading corrected for instrument and position errors is called CAS.

Aircraft without ADC may have an ASI correction table for different configuations to convert from IAS to CAS.

old term: *Rectified Airspeed RAS*.

All large aircraft display CAS on the ASI as a primary reading. Thus, IAS = CAS and no instrument or position errors need to be applied to the reading.

EFIS shows CAS!

## compressability, CAS and EAS.

In case of increasing speeds > 0.3/0.4M air starts to behave as a compressible fluid --> "compressed" in pitot tube.    
This causes the dynamic pressure to be greater than it should be. Accordingly, CAS calculated from $1/2 *\rho *v^2$ over-reads.
= compressibility error.

compressibility corrections are not required for ADC calculated speeds (Saint Venents formulae ~ assuming air is a compressible fluid).

CAS corrected for compressibility is *Equivalent Air Speed EAS*.   
The correction is always a reduction, as compressibility causes the calculated CAS to be too high.

The threshold as of which compressibility needs to be taken into account is approximate.
Compressibility is a gradual increasing factor, and insignificant in the beginning (lower speeds).    
(FAA) compressibility becomes significant at/above 200kt CAS and at/above 10 000ft ~ equating to around M0.36 in ISA.    
Most navigation computers apply compressibility correction not below 300kt TAS ~ M0.45 at MSL.

             Position


### TAS Calculation

TAS can be calculated from CAS, if you know the air pressure and temperature.    
Pressure is defined by the pressure altitude of the aircraft.

conversion from CAS to EAS requires knowledge of Mach number (M = f(CAS) + pressure altitude): CAS -- PA ($Z_p$) --> EAS     
conversion from EAS to TAS requires knowledge of air density (or density altitude)   
EAS -- DA ($Z_d$) --> TAS

## Magnetism - Compass Reading

https://www.studyaircrafts.com/compass-system

A compass is an instrument designed to indicate direction on the surface of the earth, relative to some known datum. The magnetic compass works on the principle that a freely suspended magnet will align itself with the earth's magnetic field such that one end will point toward the north magnetic pole.

The purpose of a magnetic âsteeringâ compass in an aircraft is to indicate heading, the direction in which the aircraft is pointing. Magnetic influences - iron/steel components, electric currents - distort the earthâs field so that the compass magnet assembly deviates from the magnetic meridian. This is called compass deviation.

It is mandatory that all civil aircraft must carry such a compass and in all but light general aviation aircraft it serves as a standby compass.â

### Deviation

Aircraft manufacturing --> magnetisation; aircraft degaussing.  
Residual magnetism which can influence compass readings.

Other sources: cargo

Distortion of Earth's magnetic field, or electrical fields (e.g. aircraft equipment)

### Factors affecting Deviation

Deviation experienced by an aircraft is specific to each aircraft and varies with heading and magnetic latitude.

Variation with heading occurs as resultant aircraft fields oppose Earth's field, both + or -.
On which headings this happens is dependent on how deviating fields are aligned with aircraft.

Variation with magnetic latitude is due to horizontal component of Earth's magnetic field H.
It varies in strength depending on where it is detected.
At the magnetic equator all the field is in H component, at the poles, the H component is weak to non-existing.

If H is weak, the deviating forces are proportionally stronger. 
Thus, deviation is greater near the poles and smaller at magnetic equator.

### Magnetic Direction

Variation is the difference between true and magnetic direction/headings.     
Variation east - magnetic least.    
Variation west - magnetic best.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/inst-magnetic-variation.png")
```

### Compass Direction

Influence by Earth's magnetic field. 
Compass installed in an aircraft distorts, field distorted by aircraft/metal and  electrical equipment.

==> deviation from magnetic north == compass north

Deviation is difference between Compass North CN and Magnetic North MN.

deviation east - compass least     
deviation west - compass best

+ turn to east, - turn to west

Deviation not constant for a given compass.
It varies as the aircraft's magnetic fields interfere with the Earth's magnetic fields.

Deviation varies with:

* magnetic latitude ~ strength of Earth's magnetic field
* aircraft heading ~ orientation of aircraft and interference changes
* changes in aircraft electrical equipment ~ different levels of interferring fields

### Calculations

Conversion of compass heading to true heading, etc. 

Cadbury's Dairy Milk is Very Tasty

compass heading: 222
deviation 3W:   -  3
magnetic heading: 219
variation 23E:   + 23
true heading:     242


Given true heading of 005, VAR 32W, deviation 4E. 
What is the compass heading

"CaDbury's Milk is Very Tasty":
C: 033
D: +4
M: 037
V: -32
T: 005

Given compass heading 233, true heading 246, and deviation -3,
what is the variation?

C: 233
D:  -3
M: 230
V: ==> +16 == VAR 16E
T: 246

### Determining Compass Deviation

deviation is detected by means of a compass swing. Done by licensed engineer (not a pilot).
--> compass deviation card ~ residual deviation, placed next to compass

Under EASA, CS25 requires main compass to be accurate to -/+5 degrees and standby compass to -/+10 degrees.

### Compass Serviceability Check

check before each flight: clean/clear and not distorted, liquid no bubbles and clean.
Accuracy cross check to another compass. Alternative runway (or known) heading.
(Note: runway headings are "magnetic")

procedures for
calibrating an aircraft magnetic compass to minimize the effect of aircraft-induced
magnetic fields. These procedures are often referred to as âswinging the compassâ or a
âcompass swing.

compass calibration = determining residual deviation --> compass calibration card



## Gyroscope

3 main gyroscopic instruments found on aircraft are the artificial horizon, the heading indicator, and the turn coordinator. All three use gyroscopic axes to provide a datum from which the aircraftâs orientation can be measured. More advanced systems can also be found on complex aircraft.

All gyroscopic instruments rely on using the gyroscopic axis as a datum.

gyro = turn    
skopein = see

angular momentum of a spinning body ~ moment of inertia * rate of rotation    
inertia dependent on mass, and distance from spinning axis

gimbals     
gyroscopes are usually suspended in a system of frames, i.e., gimbals    
==> freedom of movement in a defined number of planes.

a gyro must have at least one gimbal for every axis around which you need to measure movement.    
Thus, a turn coordinator measures movement around yaw-axis --> one gimbal;   
artificial horizon measures pitch and roll --> two gimbals.   


Instrument Name	    Instrument Shows	    Gyroscopic Axis Alignment
Artificial Horizon	Attitude and Bank	    Vertical to Centre of the Earth
Heading Indicator	  Heading	              Aircraft Yaw Axis
Turn Coordinator	  Rate of Turn*	        Aircraft Pitch Axis

(*) turn coordinator does not show bank angle!


### classification

* degree of freedom
* orientation of spin axis
* use

#### by degree of freedom

degree of freedom = number of axis about which gyro displacement can be measured, i.e., the number of gimbals.

spin axis is not counted as degree of freedom, as gyro displacement cannot be measured around spin axis

note: gyro rotor mounted in two gymbals with two degrees of freedom is free to move in all three planes, i.e., yaw, roll, and pitch.

Note: EASA uses planes of movement rather than degrees of freedom.
Thus, one more "plane" than "degree", because spin axis is considered as well.

#### by spin axis orientation

In aviation, 

vertical (spin axis) or     
horizontal (spin axis)

#### by use

* space gyros - 2 degrees of freedom := "free gyros" (3 planes)
* tied gyros - 2 dgrees of freedom, but with external influence controlling orientation of spin axis by typing it - for example - to the horizontal or vertical aircraft axis
* earch gyros = sub-category of tied gyros where spin axis is tied by Earth gravity to remain in Earth vertical
* rate gyros - one gimbal = one degree of freedom == sense rotation in only one plane, e.g. rate of yaw
* rate-integrating gyros = one degree of freedom == sense angular displacement


### Rate Gyros

![rate gyros](figures/inst-gyro-axes.png)

rate gyro - one gimbal --> sense movement in one plane

e.g. rate gyro sensing yaw     
gyro axis oriented horizontally across the aircraft    
gimbal pivoting around its one degree of freedom --> restraining springs resisting the pivoting and tend to restore neutral position      
yawing force twisting the moment in the horizontal plane ....

spring force produces a secondary precession equal to and in the same direction as the yaw.

dependent on orientation, rate gyro can indicate pitch or roll


heading indicator = directional gyro
suction to drive attitude and heading indicator

turn - electrical

heading indictor reference magnetic north = dial to configure orientation
horizontal gyro - plan perd to horizon - 3 degrees of freedom = regardless of aircraft movement gyro will stay in place

turn - gyro will stay rigid in place, turn left = gyro to right

excessive pituch or bank will stop ~ 85 degrees elect . air suction 55

gyroscopic apparent wander ~ rigid in space ~ earth rotation
max at poles, min at equator (aligned with meridian)   
dependent on latitude

real gyroscopic wander - wear, friction and imbalance, about 1 degree per hour
Real wander (or random wander) of a gyroscope, as opposed to apparent wander, is actual movement of the spin axis caused by engineering imperfections such as friction and unbalance.



practice: adjust HI every 10-15 mins when straight and level (= compass shows correct heading related to magnetic north)

gyromagnetic compass - remote indicating gyro / slaved gyro.    
in principle: heading indicator incorporating a "slave gyro" ; automatic alignment


### rate indigrating gyros

rate gyro --> rate of angular displacement   
rate integrating gyro --> rate of displacement and time it was applied for ~ indication of rotational displacement

rate integrating gyros ~ extreme accuracy over a small angular movement    
one degree of freedom --> rotatinal movement about one axis

gyro rotor inside a cylinder acting as sole gimbal, free to rotate inside a 2nd cylinder. The outer cylinder is filled with viscous fluid.

issue: cross-coupling

### ring laser gyros

Laser or ring laser gyro (RLG) mainly used in Inertial Reference System IRS

Uses gas discharge laser to generate monochromatic radiation in two directions.; frequenccy difference proportional to input rate ==> measured and converted to digital output signal

issue: Frequency Lock and Dither

RLG issue - frequency lock or lock-in or laser lock.    
at low input rates, frequencies of CW and CCW beams are nearly the same ~ lock ~ zero

dither = slow rotation of laser system around input axis --> ensures RLG stays out of lock-in range

INS = 3 RLGs at right angles fixed to aircraft frame    
INS measures all rotations about the three axes, giving a very accurate readout of aircraft attitude with reference to a space datum.

benefits: size, lifespan compared to conventional rate sensing or rate integrating gyros



## Turn Indicator

turn indicator and turn coordinator

balance ball ~ in or out of balance ~ too much or too little bank used for rudder deflection

indicator rate of change of aircraft heading = rate of yaw in the plane of the earth horizontal

rate gyro with horizontal axis, one gimbal, and degree of freedom    
either air/vacuum driven (suction) or electronically driven

horizontal axis parallel to lateral axis of aircraft (= pitch axis)

when aircraft banks into balanced turn, the gyro precesses in the opposite roll sense in order to keep its axis more or less with the earth horizontal.

bank angle for a given rate of turn is related to the TAS    
requires calibration to a specific range of TAS ==> turn indicator calibrated for (e.g.) Cessna will not indicator correctly in (e.g.) a jet;    
turn indicator will also not correctly if turn is not balanced because angle of bank would be incorrect.

rotates away from pilot


required angle of bank:     

* standard rate 1 turn = 180 degree per minute = 360 per 2 minutes, 3 degree per second
* standard rate 2 turn = twice = 360 per minute, 6 degree per second

$$angle\ of\ bank = (\frac{TAS}{10}) + 7$$

### Turn indications

(typical) turn indicator - one index L or R at rate 1 turn; note showing rate 1 ~ "2min turn"    
optional TIs with 2 or 3 rate turn markings

### Slip and Skid

balanced turn = coordinated amount of bank and rudder     
too much bank ~ aircraft slipping    
too little bank ~ aircraft skidding

straight and level flight ~ gravity keeps ball in center of liquid filled tube = no slip and no skid     
ditto for balanced turn

in case of too much or too little bank, the resulting force will not be through the aircraft vertical axis ==> ball displaced

"kick the ball" = more or less rudder in the direction of the ball

### Turn Coordinator

Turn Coordinator is a further developed turn indicator.

Gimbal raised at the front by 30 degrees.  
Thus, sensitive primarily to yaw, but also slightly to roll ==> begins to indicate turn as soon as aircraft starts to roll into the turn and before yaw rate is established.

Once in steady turn, there is no further roll rate and therefore the instrument only indicates yaw!

Turn coordinator only indicates rate 1 turns accurately in a tight TAS range (about 5% of specific speed), as it indicates/reacts to yaw, roll, and part of pitch.




## Attitude Indicator - Gyro Horizon or Aritifical Horizon

Direct attitude indicators use an Earth gyro = gyroscope with 2 degrees of freedom (2 gimbals), spin axis maintained in Earth vertical by gravity

Attitude indicator shows aircraft attitude in pitch and roll.

Either driven by air/vacuum (suction) or electrically.

### Air-driven AI
air drives rotor, typically rotates anti-clockwise when viewed from above.

inner gimbal --> horizon bar up/down
outer gimbal --> bank angle

gyro remains level, case pitches with horizon bar displaced to show climb or descent

ladder = major pitch attitudes numbered    
aircraft symbol (white or yellow) remains fixed to the instrument casing.

bank indications - sky pointers     
bank indictor rotates in roll with the rest of the indicator card

first 30 degrees shown in increments of 10 degrees, further indications at 45, 60 and 90 degrees

#### air driven gyro erection

Air-driven artificial horizons are made pendulous, settle gimbals ina nearly erect position when NOT working = reduces erection time at start-up

once engine has started --> gyro is rotation --> gyro axis tied to Earth vertical 

air exhausts at bottom to regulate orientation

#### electrically driven articifial horizon

same principle, rotate clockwise when viewed from above, gyro tied to Earth vertical

more rigid that air-driven gyros, electric squirrel cage motor higher spin speed, electic erection system & very quick

electrically driven artificial horizons do not suffer from turning and acceleration errors.

#### principle of operation

...

### servo driven attitude indicators

modern aircraft, instrument driven by servos    
signals amplified and set to a processor and then to the display unit: Attitude Diretor Indicator (ADI).

signals from vertical gyro also sent to autopilot and flight director.

information from other systems can be combined in the ADI, e.g. ILS localiser and glide-scope indicator, radio height, airspeed deviation from target and flight directors


### vertical guros an AHRS

advantages of using remote vertical gyro unit over basic instruments are:

* improved accuracy
* better use of space, in that the vertical gyro does not have to be installed in the instrument panel
* better maintenance access, all detectors can be comnined in a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU)
* when three vertical gyros are used their signals can be compared and a failed unit discarded

Such vertical gyros may be combined with a remote indicating compass system = Attitude and Hearding Reference System (AHRS)

AHRS gyros no longer use 2 defree of greedom to detect attitude but instead use single degree of freedom rate gyros as roll, pitch, and heading sensors combined with accelerometers in all three axes and a magnetic field detector, i.e., flux valve.

most modern AHRS use MEMS gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers on three orthogonal axes.    
MEMS smaller, lighter, accuracy, reliability, and cost

AHRS may be combined with an Air Data Computer tp make Air Data and Attidutde Heading Reference System (ADAHRS).

### EFIS Displays

modern aircraft fitted with IRS or ADAHRS take attitude signals from IRS and send them to the EFIS symbol generation fo relectronic display. = Primary Flight Display (PFD).   
PFDs can incorporate attitude information as well as airspeed / Mach number, maneuver boundaries, flight direcetors, attitude and autopilot or flight director mode indications





![PFD and ND](figures/inst-PFD-ND.png)

The main characteristic of the Navigation Display is the colour screen and the ability to display different modes and functions : route flown, VOR, AFD, ILS, Weather Radar, TCAS, etc.


## Directional gyros

apart from attitude, gyros can be used to indicate direction either on their own as a Direction Indicator (DI) or integrated into a compass system.

DI are used as a primary heading reference on light aircraft.
DI measure changes in direction relative to the Earth's surface.
such DIsare tied to the horizontal of the aircraft instead.    
== tied gyros with horizontal spin axis    
two degrees of freedeom ~ two gimbals.

DI driven by air or electricity.    
typically air-driven because they are only fitted in simple aircraft and directional gyros incorporated into other systems are typically electrically driven, because they are fitted into slightly more complex aircraft with better electrival supplies.

Directinoal gyros have 2 defrees of freedom and a horizontal spin axis.

Direction indicators fitted into simple aircraft to supplement heading information from a direct reading magnetic compass.   
The rigidity of its gyroscope gives steadier heading inforamtion than the compass (compass subject to turning and acceleration error).

A DI cannot be completely on its own. 
Subject to its own errors of apparent drift.   
Apparent drift caused by rotation of the earth and transport wnder.

both instruments are used together. 
The DI is the primary heading reference, it must be periodically reset to the heading reference from the direct reading compass when aircraft in straight and level flight.

Gimbals give freedom in pitch and roll up to about -/+ 55 degree.

Due to its rigidity the gyroscope will retain its orientation in space.
As it turns, the aircraft effectively rotates around the outer gimbal, and indicated heading is read from the scale fixed to the outer gimbal.    
The heading scale is normally round the middle of the gimbal.

### DI Gyro Erection

DI is a tied gyro - which also it is free to move in its gimbals has the spin axis held to the aircraft horizontal.   
Air is fed through nozzles mounted on the outer gimbal, itself tied to aircraft horizontal. when the rotor is erect, impinge equally on both sides of the buckets.

### DI 

* on ground whiule taxying: left turn = heading decrease, turn right (clockwise): increase

* mechanical ADI is fed attitude data from remote vertical gyro or a referencing platform. But it can be supplied from an IRS.


## Remote Reading Compasses

DI and compass = heading information.     
Both have significant errors, but used together they can perform.

Combination of both in one instrument using rigidity of gyro to stabilise the compass in the short terms but to correct for apparent wander with a continous magnetic heading input.    
== gyro compasses == remote reading gyro compasses == gyro flux gate compasses


### Radio Magnetic Indicator

information from VOR or NDB added --> RMI

* (orange triangle/top) lubber line = indicates current magnetic heading
* desired heading can be set with knob at bottom left (yellow triangle)
* green arrow indicators direction to selected VOR or NDB

### Horizontal Situation Indicator HSI

adds information on deviation from selected VOR/ILS/RNAV tracks.


### System Errors

**Deviation** remote indicating gyro compass suffers from same potential errors caused by variation in aircraft magnetism as direct reading compases - but at lesser degree due to flux valve placed as far away from disturbing sources/fields.

Deviation correction is achieved by adjusting the electromagnetic fields near the flux valve with permanent magnets.

EASA CS25 requires main comapss system to have accuracy adequate for safe operation of aeroplance. == within 5 degrees for remote indicating compass.

some authorities require residual error less than 1 degree.   
--> no compass correction card required.

**Acceleration and Turning** acceleration on take-off and deceleration on lainding will cause flux valve to swing & some liquid surrounding dampening.
Thus, moves from Earth horizontal detecting some vertical Z component == direction distortion.

Steady pitch attitude up to 25 degree from level will produce no error.
However, in steady balanced turns the flux detecter will stay level with respect to the aircraft and agins start to pick up Z component of magnet field ~ ditortion.

== various sensors incorporated to detect pitch, bank, and acceleration --> switching off when these parameters exceed limits set in the magnetic monitoring system. 


## Intertial Reference System

IRS required to maintain a very accurate reading of true north.     
Although not a compass, it is used as a heading reference.

The IRS computer will hold a variation map for the world and can display both true and magnetic heading!    
CS25 requires accuracy of 1 degree.

In earlier INS, the INS provides true heading for mixing with and stabilising the magnetic heading input from a detector.



Questions

* flux detactor detects strength and direction of the Earth's magnetic fields.
The error detector compares the flux valve reading with the 'null'/North position and expresses the difference --> heading on compass card.

* remote indicating compass fitted with free/slave swith. When slave system and system synchronised what is the source of the displayed heading
== flux detection unit.

remote indicating compass ~ 2 main parts: indicator = direction gyro until we add input from flux valve/detector.    
if switched to slave == only flux; sometimes switch Comp/DG for compass and directional gyro.

* limit deviation = mount in wingtip



DG 2 axes, incapable of self-orientation in an Earth tied position
annunciated (slaving loop)
DG 2 axes, spin axis horizontal plane by erection system

DG --> 2 errors: apparent wander/Earth rotation and transport wander/drift; no influence of longitudinal accelerations or Earth magnetic field (~ gyro!)




# Electronic Flight Instrument Systems (EFIS)

EFIS enhances attitude and navigational data.   
PFD errors --> stanby instruments, modern: Integrated Stanby Instrument System (ISIS)

Components

![EFIS](figures/inst-EFIS.png)

* electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI) = Primary Flight Display (PFD)
* electronic Horizontal Situation INdicator (EHSI) = Navigation Display (ND)
* EFIS control panel
* Symbol Generator SG (creates graphic output for display on PFD/ND)
* remote flight sensor unit

typically 2 SGs, if one fails the remaining supplies both = identical information/display; optional 3rd backup generator

# Electronic Flight Instrument Systems

EFIS replace mechanical instruments in modern aircraft.    
Focus on B737/77/777 and Airbus equivalents.

Not to be confused / compared with "modern" general aviation aircraft --> e.g. Garmin, Dunon, AvMap

EFIS ==> presentation of attitude and navigational data to flight crew.
EFIS uses modern colour graphics and are usually integrated with digital computer-based navigation systems.

EFIS now using Avtice Matrix LCD, good temperature range, lower power consumption, reduced glare (over earlier systems)

To cope with failure in the primary flight display PFD or its inputs standby instruments.
Older aircrat use analogue, consisting of AI, ASI, VSI and ALT.    
Modern aircraft is an electronic integrated Standby Instrument System (ISIS).

### Multi-crew EFIS installation

![](figures/inst-EFIS-system-layout.png)

multi-crew EFIS installation consists of left (captain) and right system (first officer).   
Each system comprises

* PFD or Electronic Attitude Director Inidcator (EADI)
* Navigational Display ND or Electronis Horiontal Situation Indicator (EHSI)
* EFIS control panel
* SG symbol Generator
* remote light sensor unit

Symbol Generator SG creates the graphic outputs for display on PFD and ND.   
A third (centre) symbol generator can be incorporated. It may be used in the event of failure of either the right or left unit.    
If 2 symbol generaturs are used and one fails, the remaining unit can supply both sides of the cockpit - but information would be the same.   
Switching is pilot controlled. 

If a dispaly unit fails, the PFD data can usually be switched to the ND or to any other available unit. This is done with the EFIS control panel.

Light aircraft use fewer displays, typically able to display both PFD and ND, and aircraft systems.

### Primary Flight Display

PFD or EADI is an electronic version of a sky pointing ADI.    
Overlay by on basic attitude information

* flight director command bars
* pitch limit sympbols
* rising runway symbol

PFD presents a dynamic colour display of all parameters necessary to control the aircraft.

PFD principle: bringing all basic-T instruments in one display.

Note: fast/slow scale indicates airspeed error of -/+ 10kts when autothrottle and acts as throttle director when thrust is manually controlled.

### Speed Tape

Speed Tape shows Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) from air data computer, 42 ... 420 kt.    
Overlaid speeds are important for handling and performance characteristics.

* landing reference speed VREF shown as green "R"
* gear and flap placard speeds are shown in red and black

yellow ~ caution range    
red and black ~ limits

V1 and VR are shown at top or bottom, if off scale

### Decision height and Radio Height

in B737 the set Decision Height (DH) can be supplemented with a digital or dial readout of the Radio ALtitude (RA).

The radio altimeter is active only below 2500ft.    
Between 1000ft and 2500ft, both the radio height and decision height are shown in figures.    
Below 1000ft, the display switches to white circular display = analogue dial readout graduated in 100ft increments - digital readout of height indicated in the center of the circle.    
Decision Height is indicated as magenta at appropriate height.    
Aural alert at 50ft above DH. ... change to white and amber/flahs for a few seconds.    
Reset button on control panel to inhibit flashing and reverts scale and marker to original colours.

B737 have DH/RA at bottom right or top right of PFD display.

A320 has DH at top right in a screen area designated 'approach' capabilities. 
It is in digirtal form, coloured in cyan (blue)     
RA is shown at bottom center of attitude display. Green until 100ft above DH --> changes to amber, flashes for 3 seconds at DH + amber DH flag appears above RA.

Both B737/A320 are supported by automatic voice call outs of DH and RA during approach.

### Pitch Limit Symbols

pitch limit eyebriws show the attitude to select in the event of a whind shear go-around or in response to a GPWS warning.    
At this attitude the aircraft will climb just on the light buffet or more precisely: stick shker.

### Flight Mode Annunciator

Autopilot modes are shown at top of the PFD in an area called the Flight Mode Annunciator (FMA).

Boeing uses a three column - two line display.    
Airbus uses five columns - three line.

"armed modes": Boeing ~ white, Airbus ~ cyan, until     
"captured/engaged": green

not all modes have "armed" state. For those using "armed", change occurs when certain criteria are met, i.e.,

* APP for approach will be white until aircraft is receiving a valid ILS GS or LOC signal ==> green

autothrottle controlling the thrust (EPR), FMS VNAV give guidance in pitch and limit the speed and FMS LNAV give guidance in roll. 

If the autopilot is not coupled, guidance information is fed to the flight directors which show the aircraf is slightly below the required profile and on left of track.

### Flight Directors

flight director bars show where the centre of the aircraft symbol "SHOULD" be placed for the required flight profile.    
An alternative EASI display for 737 uses a chevron shaped aircraft sympb


## Navigation Displays

Navigation Displays (or Electronic Horizontal SItuation Indicator) provides mode-selectable depiction of navigation and supplemental inforamtion

ND modes

* MAP (or ARC)
* VOR (or ROSE VOR)
* APP (or ROSE LS); and
* PLAN

in light aircraft, the displays are usually multi-functional with display modes emulating PFD and ND displays. The ND is likely to use GPS rather than inertial reference system source information.

Example G1000 ND

![](figures/inst-ND-Garmin1000.png)

### MAP (or ARC) Mode

MAP shows computed FMS track relative to the aircraft symbol.   
Aircraft symbol can be positioned at the centre of the display (CENTRE MAP mode), or conventionally at the bottom of the display (MAP mode).

FMS track = magenta line connecting waypoints; active waypoint is magenta, the rest white

![](figures/inst-ND-MAP.png)
MAP mode can be overlaid with other information, including weather.

off-route airfields are shown as cyan circles and VOR/DMEs are displayed in their standard symbol - cyan if not used, green if currently tuned.    
If a navigation aid is tuned, the selected radial is shown.

white straight line shows current track with range rings; 80NM shows   
green arc across track shows aircraft in climb or descent to a selected altitude and shows where the FMS has computed it will reach the altitude.

Deviation from VNAV computed flight path is shown by a separate scale on the right.

WEATHER RADAR COLOURING

rainfall severity

* black 0-1 mm/hr
* green 1-4 mm/hr
* yellow 4-12 mm/hr
* red 12-50mm/hr
* magenta >50 mm/hr

magenta is alternatively used to indicate turbulence using Doppler-based radar, by slecting WX+T or TURB on radar control panel



SYMBOLS and COLOURS

recommended EFIS colour coding is set out in the Certification Specification (CS).

The colour coding from the PFD is applied to ND with information depicted in white and the desired flight pash shown in magenta.

GREEN   active or selected data - engaged autopilot modes
WHITE   current data/values - armed autopilot modes
MAGENTA   command information, weather radar turbulence, selecting heading, flight director bars
YELLOW    cautions, abnormal sources
CYAN    non-active and background, sky
RED     waring, flight envelop & system limits
BLACK   off
BROWN/TAN   earth

AIRBUS uses GREEN to show active route rather than magenta

ALL EFIS FAILURES ARE AMBER


### Control of Data Feeds

transfer of data from one display unit to another to cover failures of the actual display units.

Failure on one side of duplicated systems can result in data being displayed on both sides of the flight deck from one common source.     
Crews will always be alerted to this, to that data can be cross-checked from standby sources or from raw data.

In light aircraft with multi-functional displays MFD: if there is more than one display unit, failures of one MFD are accommodated by using the 2nd alone.


### EFIS Control Panel

PFD and ND are controlled from (captain's and FO's) control panel(s).

![](figures/inst-PFD-ND-control.png)

PFD controls are minimal --> brightness control and mode selection, resetting of decision height.

ND --> selection type of display, weather radar display on/off.    
Map switsche vary the background information, range selector.

Range and map combination can improve situational awareness.    
Selecting a greater range will show weather radar indications that might not otherwise be seen in good time.   
Selecting ARC mode, for final approach

lower/right screen: System Display - shows secondary engine data, system information, and system schematics.


![](figures/inst-EICAS-ECAM-info.png)

### Electronic Flight Bags (EFB)

Generic term EFB means any portable electronic device for use by the flight crew.   
Could be a laptop, tablet computer, or indeed an integrated device within the flight deck (provided no tools are needed to remove).    
If permanently installed = part of the aircraft == covered by the aircraft airworthiness approval and becomes part of Minimum Equipment List (MEL).

EFB functions can include much of the work previously carried out by hand and using paper forms. An operational flight plan, with wind, drift and groundspeed calculations filled in after the CRP-5.


## Digital Computers / Circuits

computers are pervasive.

A computer can be very simply defined as a machine for manipulating data according to a list of instructions.   
Digital computers use semiconductors in integrated circuits to store and process information in binary form. 

Data in --> input peripherals --> computer --> output peripherals --> data out

### von Neumann Model

A computer has 6 basic features and capabilities.
The von Neumann model calls for 

* input and output facilities
* processing unit
* memory
* programmes and data sharing the same memory
* programme steps carried out in a sequential manner (software programme)
* processor and memory joined as a pair

![](figures/inst-comp-vonNeumann.png)

### Central Processing Unit CPU

Computers have one or more CPUs.   
CPU to execture the programmes stored in the memory by fetching the instructions, examining then, and then executing them in a sequential manner.

CPU task can be described as: fetch-decode-execute cycle.

CPU has 3 components

* control unit - responsible for fetchnig instructions from memory and determining their type
* arithmetic and locig unit (ALU) - performing the arithmetical and logical operations
* (small high speed) memory - to store temporary results and control information. The memory is made up of registers, often only 32 bits big.

### Memory

memory = to store programmes and data while the computer is operating, and - in some cases - when the computer is turned off.    
If information does disappear when the power is off: volatile memory.

Two main types of memory are: RAM and ROM.

Most common form: Random Access Memory (RAM) ~ read/write memory.   
Data in RAM can be changed easily while the computer is operating.

semiconductor RAM can be devided in 2 sub-categories:

* static RAM, and 
* dynamic RAM (DRAM).

Static RAM will hold information without being refreshed as long as the power is on.   
Dynamic RAM needs refreshing every few milliseconds. DRAM 'simplicity' ~ allows four times the density of static RAM, but is slower to use than static RAM.

ROM - read-only memory; data stored in a chip that cannot be erased intentionally or otherwise. Used for start-up programmes and standard mathematical routines.

PROM - programmable read-only memory; can be programmed once into a "blank" chip making manufacture easier.

EPROM - erasable programmable read only memory; chips to be re-used after a (lengthy) erasing process.

### input and output interfaces

input interface = convert input data from a format that humans can use to something the computer can use.   
example: CDU keyboard of a FMC --> information going in is analogue, and it must be converted to digital data for the computer. This involves an analogue / digital conversion at the input interface.

Output interface use (often) a digital/analogue conversion to change computer data into human readable data. A CDU dispaly screen on a FMC converts digital into graphical information.

### software

..... binary 0-1

64-bit binary  
decimal system: the greater the number of digits available, the greate ther range of numbers we can display    
==> 4 digits available --> 10.000 numbers, i.e., from 0000 to 9999

binary equivalent to 9999 uses 14 digits

==> 64-bit computer uses binary code with 64 digits    
==> each instruction could be one of (2^64 - 1) possibilities.

hexadecimal  
==> more compact form; hexadecimal uses based 16 (16 possibilities for each bit)

machine code    
computer languages can be written in humanfriendly format - then converted into hexadecimal or binary machine code.    
rule of machine code are particular to every CPU and dependent on CPU architecture.   
Thus, machine-code written for on CPU not 'portable' to another type of CPU.

assembly - conversion computer programme to machine code   
assembler - utility software used to carry out the assembly process.

assembly languages

low-level vs high-level languages    
high-level languages: Java, C++, or C#    
programmers will (still) use assembly languages when dealing with mission-critical systems often running on embedded devices.   
example: automatic braking system, flight control systems.

programming in assembly language is generally regarded as a more robust way to create software for embedded devices.    
~ high-level languages offer alternative

Thus, assembly language 

* is used to programme mission-critical software
* is more user-friendly than machine code
* is a low level language; and
* files must be abstracted into machine code to be used by computers.

abstraction ~ degree to which a (computer) language uses easily understood phrases.   
A language may use a term to describe a process, but the way that process is implemented by the computer is hidden from the programmer.    

low-level: to display something on the screen: programmer needs to specify what to display and how the item should look (colours, fonts, ...)    
high-level: it is not necessary to specify how to go about displaying somethig on a screen.

The amount of abstraction defines how "high-level" a programming language is.   
reminder: assembly = low-level language.

files produced in high-level languages must be converted before they can be used by a computer. This process is called 'compiling'.    
a.) 2 steps: high-level language --> assembly language --> abstracted in machine code
b.) 1 step: directly compiled to machine code.

![](figures/inst-comp-high-level-vs-low-level.png)
scripting languages

scripting languages do not undergo similar conversion to produce a file wihch can run on a computer.    
Scripts are sets of instructions which are interrogated by other software.    
E.g. website pages with embedded scripts (possibly Javascript) -- the browser interrogates the webpage that contains the script(s).   
Two way communication between browser and script:   
script give instructions to browser or data based in the information passed to the script by the browser.

E.g. webpage recognising country you are in.

ASP, Javascript, Perl, Python

![](figures/inst-comp-scripting-languages.png)

### Connections

Computers on an aircraft would be useless, if they were unable to communicate with each other.   
The approach used is to connect them using 'computer buses'.   
Latin 'omnibus' meaning 'all together'. 

Computer buses may be 

* serial - where the data is sent in packages one after the other; or
* parallel - where multiple data paths exists, allowing flow in both directions.

Early systems used 'daisy chaining' = data passed through each part of the system to reach its destination.

Example of a data bus on a modern aircraft is the controller aera network CANBUS.   
Originally from automobile industry, adopted by Airbus for the A380.    
CANBUS connects all of the electronic control units involved in a group of functions by serial connections.

Operating systems are termed 'multi-tasking' as they allow more than one programme to run at the same time. --> actually sequentially = software solution    
Not to be confused with 'multi-processing' ~ more than one processor (2 or more CPUs) are used to operate a single computer programme. = hardware solution

Multi-processing is the case for most airborne systems (some multi-tasking) ~ safety back.

Differnt parts of the aircraft may use variations of operating systems.    
The FMS is a much bigger type of OS than - for example - the ATSU which has far fewer functions to handle.     
Simple systems, e.g. Air Data Computer ADC, only has to execute a relatively simple mathematical functions such as deriving SAT from TAT.

Flight safety regarding computer software and electronic documentation on aircrafr is certified under EROCAE standards.   
ED-12B "Software Considerations in AIrborne Systems and Equipment Certification" details requirements for software planning development and safety.

Note: software is never certified as standalone entity. Respective hardware is also considered.     
The idea of system safety is crucial to how the regulation within E12B used to certify airborne equirments.

5 levels oare defined

failure   software
catastrophic A
hazardous    B
major        C
minor        D
no-effect    E

an aircraft with fly-by-wire flight controls is computer controlled. failur of the software would be catastropic. Software level 'A' is defined as meaning that failure woud result in the loss of ability to continue safe flight and landing.

Failure at level C, C, D would increase crew workload and reduce operational taksinging of the aircraft - but would not prevent safe flight.   
e.g. failure of FMC.

Failure of level E software would have no effect on operations or pilot workload.   
e.g. in-flight entertainment equipment.






Questions

rate of turn - directly proportional to bank angle - inverse proportional to TAS == independent of aircraft weight    
$RoT = \frac{(g * tan(\text{bank angle}))}{TAS}$

angle of bank = $\frac{TAS}{10} + 7$; e.g. 100kts = (100/10) + 7 = 17; 200/10 + 7 = 27

the faster we fly, the more to bank to keep a specific bank angle
