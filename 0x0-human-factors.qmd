## Threat and Error Management

ICAO Annex 1 defines **error management** as *the process of detecting and responding to errors with countermeasures that reduce or eleminate the consequences of errors and mitigate the probablity of further errors or undesired states*.

* **error tolerance** minimising the effect of errors and as tolerant as possible --> system's ability to sustain itself despite the occurance of an error

* **error reduction** minimise probability of an error occurring and also minimising the extent of the error.

* **error prevention** avoiding an error.

* **error recovery** return system back to its original state after the occurrence of an error.

* otoliths in the utriculus and sacculus: GRAVITY and LINEAR accelerations
* semicircular canals: ANGULAR accelerations
